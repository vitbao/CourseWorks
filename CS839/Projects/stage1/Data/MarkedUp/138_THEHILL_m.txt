Sen. <pname>Kirsten Gillibrand</pname>    (D-N.Y.) and other Senate Democrats are jockeying for potential White House runs, but her unabashed style is drawing friendly fire that could hamper a 2020 bid. She scored an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes” that aired on Sunday, which billed her as one of the “most prominent political faces of the #MeToo movement.” The high-profile media appearance, coupled with her public rebukes of former President <pname>Clinton</pname> and ex-Sen. <pname>Al Franken</pname>    (D-Minn.), has stirred some ill will among Senate Democrats — who sense a whiff of political opportunism. Her willingness to call out fellow Democrats has made her controversial within the Washington power establishment, which could be an asset on the campaign trail. Sunday’s “60 Minutes” piece described <pname>Gillibrand</pname> as a “lightning rod” for criticizing <pname>Clinton</pname> over his White House sex scandal and for leading the charge to push <pname>Franken</pname> out of Congress following multiple sexual harassment allegations. Some Democratic strategists predict <pname>Gillibrand</pname>’s statement last fall that <pname>Clinton</pname> should have resigned over the <pname>Monica Lewinsky</pname> affair will come back to haunt her. The comment caused so much agitation in Democratic circles that <pname>Allida Black</pname>, the co-founder of the <pname>Clinton</pname> super PAC Ready for <pname>Hillary</pname> who was married by <pname>Gillibrand</pname>, canceled a fundraiser for the senator. “She was disappointed with <pname>Gillibrand</pname> and going back and talking about all this stuff with <pname>Bill Clinton</pname>    after all this had been litigated,” one person familiar with the situation told The Hill. “But she also noticed people were upset and the money was drying up.” Even though the comments clearly miffed those in her party, <pname>Gillibrand</pname> hasn’t reached out to <pname>Clinton</pname>, according to a source familiar with the matter. When asked by “60 Minutes” whether she had contacted the <pname>Clintons</pname>, <pname>Gillibrand</pname> declined to comment.
