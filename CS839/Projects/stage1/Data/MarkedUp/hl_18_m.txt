On Sunday night, during the Super Bowl (and as a Jet fan, it’s a relief not to see the Patriots win for a change), a number of exciting Trailers dropped. There were fun looks at Avengers: Infinity War, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, Solo: A Star Wars Story, and more, but the one film that really captured the imagination was The Cloverfield Paradox. Once known as God Particle, this was always rumored to have been reconfigured as a Cloverfield outing, much like 10 Cloverfield Lane, and the Teaser, then Trailer made that clear. Not only had Netflix officially acquired it, but they released it right after the game ended. Having watched it, I can say that it’s unfortunately a mess of a movie, but for fans of this franchise, it offers some juicy tidbits.

The film is a science fiction thriller, set within the Cloverfield universe. When it was called God Particle, this was the meager plot synopsis: “God Particle focuses on a group of astronauts aboard an international space station who make a shocking discovery and must fight for their survival.” Once it was revealed to be what it was, the description was updated on IMDb to be this: “Orbiting a planet on the brink of war, scientists test a device to solve an energy crisis, and end up face-to-face with a dark alternate reality.” <pname>Julius Onah</pname> directs a script by <pname>Doug Jung</pname> and <pname>Oren Uziel</pname>. <pname>Dan Mindel</pname> provides the cinematography, while <pname>Bear McCreary</pname> composed the score. Of course, <pname>J.J. Abrams</pname> produces.

Despite some interesting moments, this feels like a failure to me. The filmmaking is incredibly bland, the story can’t figure out if it’s having fun with the weirdness or not, and the tie in to Cloverfield is gimmicky, leaving you with way more questions than answers. Frankly, it’s also a waste of a talented cast too. As much as it’s a bad look for Paramount to not put this out in theaters, it’s also somewhat understandable considering the quality is not up to snuff. Netflix found a clever way to drum up some publicity, but once folks actually saw it, the buzz has been decidedly negative.
There’s apparently a fourth installment coming later on this year, presumably another retrofitted film too. That one is currently called Overlord (before it becomes Cloverlord or something) and is only described as “The story of two American soldiers behind enemy lines on D Day.” Scheduled for release on October 26th, it could further complicate the Cloverfield universe. I was delighted by 10 Cloverfield Lane, after loving Cloverfield, but the franchise might have jumped the shark at this point. One good one can fix a bad one, for sure, but at the very least, my enthusiasm for the idea has waned a great deal.
