Whether you’re a cinephile or not, it’s impossible to escape the raves of news surrounding sexual assault in Hollywood. We’ve all heard the horrifying details surrounding <pname>Harvey Weinstein</pname>, not to mention <pname>James Toback</pname> and <pname>Kevin Spacey</pname>, among others (plus, you know, the current President, as well as Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama), and it’s both shocking and upsetting in equal measure. At the same time as all of this has been coming out, a small film has been in theaters tackling the same subject matter. It’s called The Light of the Moon and inadvertently has become the most timely movie of 2017 right now. A quality picture, it could help shine a light on just what the numerous victims of these monsters are going through.

The film is a drama looking at how sexual assault and rape culture can impact a life. I’ll let the Rotten Tomatoes plot summary set the stage: “<pname>Bonnie</pname>, a young and successful Latina architect, is sexually assaulted while walking home from an evening out with friends in Brooklyn. At first, she attempts to keep the assault a secret from her long-term boyfriend <pname>Matt</pname>, but the truth quickly emerges. <pname>Bonnie</pname> emphatically denies the impact of what has just happened to her. She fights to regain normalcy and control of her life, but returning to her old life is more complicated than expected. Her attempt to recapture the intimacy she previously had with <pname>Matt</pname> falters and cracks begin to surface in their relationship. Another attack in the neighborhood only drives <pname>Bonnie</pname> further into denial, before an encounter with an at-risk woman causes her to face the truth and confront her own self-blame.” <pname>Jessica M. Thompson</pname> writes and directs, with <pname>Stephanie Beatriz</pname> playing <pname>Bonnie</pname> and <pname>Michael Stahl-David</pname> as <pname>Matt</pname>.
