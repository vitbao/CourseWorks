Phantom Thread is the second collaboration between the writer-director <pname>Paul Thomas Anderson</pname> and the actor <pname>Daniel Day-Lewis</pname>—and if the latter is to be believed, it will be the last. <pname>Day-Lewis</pname> has announced that he is retiring following this performance. I don’t doubt the sincerity of this vow, but I dearly hope he will change his mind. (<pname>Steven Soderbergh</pname> did, after all.) At 60, <pname>Day-Lewis</pname> has many more years—and, with luck, memorable performances—ahead of him. <pname>Anderson</pname>’s previous collaboration with <pname>Day-Lewis</pname>, There Will Be Blood, was very nearly a masterpiece before it undid itself in the final act. Like that film, Phantom Thread is the story of a difficult, exacting man. But befitting their respective titles, it unfolds in a gentler key. <pname>Reynolds Woodcock</pname> (<pname>Day-Lewis</pname>) is a master dressmaker in mid-century London: prim, meticulous, and—as one character describes him—“fussy.” He lives and works in a grand house with his sister, <pname>Cyril</pname> (<pname>Lesley Manville</pname>), and a series of muses who are discarded once they cease to inspire him. We meet one such woman in an early breakfast scene. “Where have you gone, <pname>Reynolds</pname>?” she pleads with him. “Is there anything I can say that will get your attention back on me?” There is not, and she is quickly shipped out of the house with a dress for her troubles. This is the first of several fraught breakfasts throughout the film; as <pname>Cyril</pname> later explains of her brother, “If breakfast isn’t right, it’s very hard for him to recover for the rest of the day.” As noted: fussy. It is over another breakfast that he discovers another muse, <pname>Alma</pname> (<pname>Vicky Krieps</pname>), who waits on his table at a hotel restaurant. She is of indeterminate non-British origin—the actress herself is from Luxembourg—and <pname>Reynolds</pname> finds himself intrigued. He asks her to dinner, where he promptly blots off her lipstick so he can better “see” her. Romantic? Possibly. Controlling? Without question.
