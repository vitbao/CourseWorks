<pname>Alicia Vikander</pname> is staying busy, as Variety reports she has just signed on to star in an adaptation of The Marsh King’s Daughter. The movie is being directed by <pname>Morten Tyldum</pname> (The Imitation Game, Passengers), and it will follow the plot of the best-selling novel by <pname>Karen Dionne</pname>, which finds a woman named <pname>Helena</pname> (<pname>Vikander</pname>) doing her best to live a normal life after spending a chunk of her younger years held captive in the forest by her father, who was creepily known as the “Marsh King” for keeping his wife and daughter in isolation. <pname>Helena</pname>’s past then becomes her terrifying present when her dad escapes from prison. In addition to direction from <pname>Tyldum</pname>, the script comes from <pname>Elle Smith</pname> and <pname>Mark L. Smith</pname>, the latter of which wrote The Revenant — and who knows isolation in the woods better than him?
