In the days since the revelations about <pname>Louis C.K.</pname>’s harassment and sexual misconduct toward other comedians and colleagues (which he admitted to in a statement), it’s been jarring to see how quickly much of the art he made has taken on a different, more disturbing, animus. His stand-up, which was always brutally frank and sexually explicit, openly referenced his compulsive masturbation habits. His critically acclaimed FX show <pname>Louie</pname> feels grimmer, particularly the episode in which he clumsily forces himself on his friend. <pname>C.K.</pname>’s new film, I Love You, Daddy, which may never be released, sounds horrifying when its plot is described. It’s not like fans, or critics, were unaware of <pname>C.K.</pname>’s tendency to unveil his darkest urges on stage and on screen. The difference, really, is that his art now feels like a smokescreen, less truthful and even more self-involved. <pname>C.K.</pname> is one of the most influential comedians of his generation, at the forefront of the “confessional” comedy genre that thrived on so-called naked honesty. But the depravity of his personal and professional behavior—masturbating in front of women—should serve as a reminder that his performances were often exactly that: a way to control the narrative about himself.
