When Marvel Studios released the original Thor in 2011, it was their trickiest franchise to date: This time the hero was not an irradiated Earthling or a guy in a metal suit, but a surfer-blond extraterrestrial who also happened to be a Norse god with a magic hammer. Wisely, the studio chose to forego (as the comic eventually had) his alter ego as a hobbled physician with a walking stick that could suddenly make him—boom!— the God of Thunder. (Way too Shazam.) But the Thor franchise has been a balancing act from the start. The first film had the mildly Shakespearian vibe that one might have expected from its director, <pname>Kenneth Branagh</pname>; the second capitalized on the realization that its titular hero, played by <pname>Chris Hemsworth</pname>, was less compelling than his Asgardian adopted brother and nemesis, Loki (<pname>Tom Hiddleston</pname>).
