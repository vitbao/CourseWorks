Today is the day for DC and Warner Brothers. At long last, all of their superheroes are sharing the screen. A few hours from now, the first public screenings of Justice League will begin, giving fans a chance to not just see Batman, Superman (yes, he’s in it…duh), and Wonder Woman on screen, but also Aquaman, Flash, and more. This has been the goal since Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was first given the thumbs up. So, what about the quality? Well, it’s better than Suicide Squad, I’ll give it that. Where it stands elsewhere, well, that’s something we’ll get to below…

The film continues the story began in Man of Steel and continued in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Taking place after the events of the latter, the world now lives with the death of <pname>Clark Kent</pname>/Superman (<pname>Henry Cavill</pname>). His sacrifice has spurred on <pname>Bruce Wayne</pname>/Batman (<pname>Ben Affleck</pname>) to take his heroism on a global level, especially when it seems parademons are scouting Earth for a takeover. 

<pname>Danny Elfman</pname> contributes the score, while cinematography is by <pname>Fabian Wagner</pname>.

Be sure to check out Justice League, in theaters everywhere this weekend!
