“What do you think?” asks <pname>Tommy Wiseau</pname> (<pname>James Franco</pname>), the pale, peculiarly dressed, raven-haired man of ambiguous age and accent at the center of the movie The Disaster Artist. “Am I villain?” The friend he’s asking, <pname>Greg Sestero</pname> (<pname>Dave Franco</pname>), has been roped into co-starring in <pname>Wiseau</pname>’s directorial debut film The Room, and might be forgiven for answering in the affirmative. <pname>Wiseau</pname> certainly has a touch of the night about him. He’s usually wearing wraparound sunglasses, his hair is draped over his shoulders with medieval flair, and his vaguely Eastern European speech patterns could be described as Dracula-esque. The first part of The Disaster Artist follows <pname>Wiseau</pname> and <pname>Sestero</pname> trying to hack it in Hollywood for a while with no luck. At one acting class, a teacher suggests <pname>Wiseau</pname> go out for more nefarious roles that better suit his look. “I’m trying to give you a shortcut,” the teacher insists. But <pname>Wiseau</pname> rejects him (and all the classmates that begin to laugh at him), yelling, “I hero, you all villain!”
