In a New York Times interview over the weekend, <pname>Uma Thurman</pname> shared stunning footage of a life-threatening car wreck that happened on set of Kill Bill. Director <pname>Quentin Tarantino</pname> wanted <pname>Thurman</pname> herself, not a stunt driver, to operate a car that she felt was unsafe. During the stunt, <pname>Thurman</pname> lost control of the car during the movie’s memorable convertible scene, leaving her with permanent damage to her knees and neck, and a concussion at the time. It wasn’t until 15 years later, after years of persistence, that <pname>Tarantino</pname> gave <pname>Thurman</pname> footage of the crash, a videotape producer <pname>Harvey Weinstein</pname> and his lawyers refused to turn over.
On Monday, <pname>Thurman</pname> posted an excerpt of video from the crash to her Instagram, along with a caption saying she doesn’t hold <pname>Tarantino</pname> responsible. The blame belongs to <pname>Weinstein</pname>, his lawyers, and her agency CAA, <pname>Thurman</pname> says. “THE COVER UP after the fact is UNFORGIVABLE,” she wrote. “For this I hold <pname>Lawrence Bender</pname>, <pname>E. Bennett Walsh</pname>, and the notorious <pname>Harvey Weinstein</pname> solely responsible. They lied, destroyed evidence, and continue to lie about the permanent harm they caused and then chose to suppress. The cover up did have malicious intent, and shame on these three for all eternity.”
