This article contains major spoilers for Star Wars: The Last Jedi.For 40 years, the Star Wars saga has largely been one of good guys and bad guys, of the Rebels and the Empire, of the Light Side and Dark Side of the Force. Those straightforward, elemental stakes were crucial to <pname>George Lucas</pname>’s original pitch for the space-opera series. <pname>J.J. Abrams</pname> said that when he began devising the story for Star Wars: The Force Awakens—the long-awaited seventh episode of the franchise that came out in 2015—he quickly realized the film had to return to that good-vs.-evil dynamic, even though Return of the Jedi (a.k.a. Episode VI) had ended with the downfall of the Empire. “We very consciously tried to borrow familiar beats so the rest of the movie could hang on something that we knew was Star Wars,” <pname>Abrams</pname> said after the film’s release. A bold group of Rebels doing battle against a monolithic Empire was thus recast as an independent Resistance fighting off the new threat of the First Order, with both sides consciously styling their look and their tactics after their forbears. <pname>Abrams</pname>’s decision was simple almost to a fault—but forgivably so, given how much additional work the director had to do in terms of setting up the film’s new characters.
