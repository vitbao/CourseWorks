Usually, when a film goes through last-minute reshoots, it’s to remove a location, or a specific set piece—like how Spider-Man removed an action scene involving the World Trade Center post–9/11, or how Gangster Squad spent weeks changing a gun battle set inside a movie theater because of the 2012 Aurora shooting. But with his film All the Money in the World, <pname>Ridley Scott</pname> is excising a person: The director is spending millions of dollars (of the studio Sony’s money) to totally cut out <pname>Kevin Spacey</pname>, the subject of many sexual-assault allegations who has seen his vaunted reputation obliterated in recent weeks. The performer, who had a supporting role, will be replaced by the Oscar-winner <pname>Christopher Plummer</pname>. <pname>Spacey</pname>’s rapid downfall came after the actor <pname>Anthony Rapp</pname> accused him, in a story for BuzzFeed, of making a sexual advance toward him in 1986, when <pname>Rapp</pname> was 14. Several others (some anonymous) have come forward with similar tales of predatory behavior, while eight House of Cards staff members told CNN about <pname>Spacey</pname> allegedly groping and harassing people on set. House of Cards has already suspended production on its sixth season and fired <pname>Spacey</pname>. Producers are now considering whether to kill off his character and hand the show over to his co-star <pname>Robin Wright</pname>, with a Variety story noting 300 cast and crew members would lose their jobs should the series come to a sudden end. Sony and <pname>Scott</pname> are adopting a similar line of thinking with All the Money in the World, a true-crime thriller about the 1973 kidnapping of <pname>John Paul Getty III</pname>.
