It’s lyrically about food, a poetic work waxing about loss, grief, and how the taste and aroma of given dishes can comfort the afflicted and almost revive the dead. “Aubergine” is one of several slow-cooking dramas that opened over the weekend as Washington’s second Women’s Voices Theater Festival nears its end; by now only two of this winter’s two dozen shows have yet to open. International characters and historical excavations are strong festival currents, though “Aubergine,” “All She Must Possess” and “No Word in Guyanese for Me” are only eddies. “All She Must Possess” at Rep Stage takes a local interest in Baltimore’s <pname>Etta</pname> and <pname>Claribel Cone</pname>, collectors during the early 20th century of pioneering modern art. <pname>Susan McCully</pname>’s 75-minute drama is like watching paint dry as she creates a playwright character who frets about how to write the play. Technically, that’s an apt question when dealing with rule-breaking artists, and it lets <pname>McCully</pname> foreground a quest to uncover hidden sexuality in the works and in the biographies. The show seems promising as the lights rise on <pname>Daniel Ettinger</pname>’s art gallery set of empty frames on a gray wall, but then so very little happens. <pname>Henri Matisse</pname> (<pname>Nigel Reed</pname>) strides in speaking in manifestos about feeling and expressing, and a panel slides open to reveal <pname>Teresa Castracane</pname> as a painting talking back. But the art-theory experiment is never so alive as when <pname>Grace Bauer</pname>, as the likable, tentative <pname>Etta</pname>, has a tantalizing flirtation with <pname>Valerie Leonard</pname>’s <pname>Gertrude Stein</pname>. It’s all talk, but <pname>Stein</pname>’s pounding repetitive words circulate in a way that illustrates what the play is interested in — the mist of expression and the elusiveness of meaning, and of people. <pname>Grace Bauer</pname> and <pname>Valerie Leonard</pname> in “All She Must Possess.” (<pname>Katie Simmons-Barth</pname>) The story of <pname>Hanna</pname> in <pname>Wendy Graf</pname>’s “No Word in Guyanese for Me,” on the other hand, couldn’t be more direct. It’s a solo show in which <pname>Ashley K. Nicholas</pname> plays <pname>Hanna</pname>, a Guyanese Muslim who is brought to New York City as a girl. The story flits back and forth and finds its tension as <pname>Hanna</pname> realizes she’s gay, which of course means she’s ostracized by her faith community. It’s an old story, but <pname>Graf</pname> gives <pname>Hanna</pname> a personable voice that <pname>Nicholas</pname> plays endearingly in the intimate District of Columbia Arts Center. “Aubergine” at the Olney Theatre Center is an elegiac affair, directed somberly by <pname>Vincent M. Lancici</pname> of Baltimore’s Everyman Theatre. (This co-production moves to Everyman later in the spring.) <pname>Cho</pname> uses food as both the bridge and the gulf between a talented young Korean American chef named <pname>Ray</pname> and his father, a flinty immigrant who never got along with his child. This father-son heartburn — another old story — is one-sided. The father is dying, getting hospice care at home and almost always asleep. <pname>Cho</pname> pens monologues, tableau images and realistic exchanges that don’t heat up as a single harmonious dish. At least it’s a handsomely produced show. <pname>Misha Kachman</pname>’s understated design has style (kitchen to the side, evocative projections occasionally taking over the view), and the cast is compelling, from <pname>Megan Anderson</pname>’s opening monologue as a foodie to <pname>Tony Nam</pname>’s brooding <pname>Ray</pname> and <pname>Song Kim</pname>’s wry turn as an uncle who only speaks Korean. But the grief doesn’t run deep because we see so little of the life. It’s like seeing a menu but never getting the food. Aubergine, by <pname>Julia Cho</pname>.
