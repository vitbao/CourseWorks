Starting tomorrow, Park City over in the state of Utah transforms. It goes from being a quiet ski resort town to the epicenter of the independent film world. Of course, we all know why. Yes, the Sundance Film Festival will be getting underway, and that’s exciting for all sorts of cinephiles. We’ll be on the lookout for which titles could turn out to be Academy Award players, following in the recent footsteps of The Big Sick, Call Me By Your Name, Manchester by the Sea, and Mudbound, but that’ll reveal itself in time. For the moment, before any fo the movies have played, there’s plenty to be excited about. Below you’ll see 12 flicks that personally have my interest. With any luck, they’ll all turn out to be Oscar players…

Here now are a dozen movies to look forward to at the Sundance Film Festival:

Blaze – <pname>Ethan Hawke</pname> steps behind the camera once again for this look at the life of musician <pname>Blaze Foley</pname>. <pname>Hawke</pname> co-writes and directs, while the cast includes <pname>Sam Rockwell</pname>. Expectations are high for this one, to say the least. <pname>Hawke</pname> is an underrated filmmaker, so don’t sleep on this one.

Burden – A potential awards player if handled right, this drama could see <pname>Garrett Hedlund</pname> get Oscar attention. <pname>Hedlund</pname> plays a Klu Klux Klansman going through a reformation with the help of an African American reverend (played by <pname>Forrest Whitaker</pname>). Assuming it deals deftly with the material…which out.

The Catcher Was a Spy – This odd sounding flick could end up being an interesting and unusual biopic. <pname>Paul Rudd</pname> portrays <pname>Moe Berg</pname>, a baseball player doubling as essentially a secret agent during the war. The rest of the cast is solid and the premise is juicy, so if there’s a big money buy at the festival, this might be it.
