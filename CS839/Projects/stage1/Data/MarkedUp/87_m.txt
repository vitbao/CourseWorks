Was there a mustache that had a bigger cinematic impact on 2017 than <pname>Henry Cavill</pname>’s? The actor’s lush whiskers were apparently so necessary for his role in the upcoming Mission: Impossible — Fallout, that Paramount refused to let him shave them off to complete his Justice League reshoots. <pname>Cavill</pname> was supposed to be fully wrapped on his Superman duties by the time he started filming M:I 6, but because of these scheduling conflicts, we ended up with that rubberized <pname>Kirk Douglas</pname> jaw featured in a few shots of Justice League.
A mustache with that much Hollywood clout practically deserves a studio contract of its own and it seems <pname>Cavill</pname>’s facial hair thinks it deserves its own social-media account, too. The bristles have now taken over <pname>Cavill</pname>’s Instagram (a true palace of wonders) to premiere the first full-length Fallout trailer, treating the clip like its own personal cotillion. <pname>Henry</pname>’s mustache would like all the haters, the lovers, and <pname>Demi Lovato</pname> to know: You are seen.
