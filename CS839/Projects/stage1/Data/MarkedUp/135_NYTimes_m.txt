 Handsome cinematography and a highly competent supporting cast — including <pname>Michelle Monaghan</pname>, <pname>Nathan Lane</pname> and <pname>Alex Karpovsky</pname> — can’t save “The Vanishing of Sidney Hall,” a tortured mystery dripping with pretentiousness. Harboring enough trauma to fuel several seasons of “This Is Us,” the story (by the director, <pname>Shawn Christensen</pname>, and <pname>Jason Dolan</pname>) might have packed more heat had it unfolded in linear form. Instead, it flashes repeatedly in and out of three distinct timelines in which <pname>Sidney</pname> (played throughout by <pname>Logan Lerman</pname>) is first a precociously talented teenager, then a celebrated but imploding novelist married to his high school sweetheart (<pname>Elle Fanning</pname>) and last a hirsute hobo living off the grid. Between these periods lies a world of hurt that includes suicide, sexual abuse and probable brain damage, all of it barely teased until a walloping final reveal — a dump of distress that feels wholly unearned. Characters are sketched instead of developed, the looping structure blurring some (most egregiously, <pname>Blake Jenner</pname>’s critical role as a troubled jock and <pname>Margaret Qualley</pname>’s blink-and-you-miss-it turn as a melting-down mistress) and eliding others. A preview of the film. Only <pname>Kyle Chandler</pname>, who could inject authenticity into the most ludicrous character, escapes unscathed. Playing a mysterious stranger who’s doggedly investigating <pname>Sidney</pname>’s third-act disappearance, Mr. <pname>Chandler</pname> weaves a thread of stability around a disastrously fragmented plot. Yet his character’s devotion to <pname>Sidney</pname>’s redemption feels entirely undeserved. Introduced while smugly declaiming his masturbatory fantasies to his high school English class, <pname>Sidney</pname> is barely bearable. The movie tries to convince us it’s not his fault, but, really, we don’t care.
