For some filmmakers, it always seems like just a matter of time until they create something that Academy voters fall head over heels in love with. <pname>Guillermo del Toro</pname> is certainly someone in that category. Even though Pan’s Labyrinth had been nominated for Oscars, <pname>del Toro</pname> seemed to still have a big player in him. Well, opening this week, we have it in The Shape of Water. Not just his most awards friendly movie to date, it’s likely going to be cited by many as among the best films of the year. As such, it’s most certainly a contender to reckon with.

The film is a fantasy drama/romance, essentially a hybrid tale as only <pname>del Toro</pname> could tell it. In fact, I’ll let IMDb describe it, since their description is pretty spot on: “An other-worldly fairy tale, set against the backdrop of Cold War era America circa 1962. In the hidden high-security government laboratory where she works, lonely <pname>Elisa</pname> (<pname>Sally Hawkins</pname>) is trapped in a life of isolation. <pname>Elisa</pname>’s life is changed forever when she and co-worker <pname>Zelda</pname> (<pname>Octavia Spencer</pname>) discover a secret classified experiment.” That’s a solid set up for what’s to come, though it doesn’t take into account <pname>Elisa</pname>’s kind neighbor <pname>Giles</pname> (<pname>Richard Jenkins</pname>), the evil government agent in charge of the lab Strickland (<pname>Michael Shannon</pname>), or any of the surprises to come. The aforementioned <pname>del Toro</pname> co-writes with Vanessa Taylor and directs. <pname>Alexandre Desplat</pname> contributes another wonderful score, while the cinematography is by <pname>Dan Laustsen</pname>.
