The masterful shot that closes Call Me by Your Name asks the viewer to do the same thing the character on screen is doing: think. Over seven minutes, <pname>Elio Perlman</pname>, the 17-year-old played by <pname>Timothée Chalamet</pname>, simply stares into a crackling fireplace as tears well in his eyes. He presumably is reflecting on his tryst with <pname>Oliver</pname>, <pname>Armie Hammer</pname>’s 24-year-old grad student who visited <pname>Elio</pname>’s Italian home for the summer. And on <pname>Elio</pname>’s own father’s life in the closet, revealed to him toward the end of the film. And maybe on his future, perched as he is on the cusp of adulthood, and having just had an affair that felt life-changing. The audience should be reflecting on those things, too. It’s possible, though, they’d be considering something surely not on <pname>Elio</pname>’s mind: AIDS. At least, that was the case for me—a fact that has gotten me into arguments with friends who are, understandably, wary of over-reading a film devoted to young love’s bittersweetness and the glory of short shorts. The acclaim for <pname>Luca Guadagnino</pname>’s adaptation of <pname>André Aciman</pname>’s novel has, overwhelmingly, focused on its cinematic loveliness and emotional power. As <pname>Guadagnino</pname>’s camera inhabits the gaze of a young man whose fantasy becomes reality, it refreshingly depicts “a story of queer love that isn’t tinged with horror or tragedy,” as my colleague <pname>David Sims</pname> wrote. The flip side is that Call Me by Your Name’s prettiness has come in for rebuke, too, with some critics faulting it for trying too much to appeal to a “universal” audience, and others asking why it has won so much more attention than more provocative, political queer stories. But I’d argue there actually is a tinge of tragedy to Call Me by Your Name, and part of the richness of the movie is in the way it makes a larger point while mostly keeping politics off screen. The story does feel sealed, its characters happily isolated in a landscape of ripe fruit and ancient ruins that almost feels pre-electricity. Yet on the edges of the film are reminders of the broader social struggle that <pname>Elio</pname> and <pname>Oliver</pname> feel temporarily exempted from—and maybe, just maybe, of the epidemic that queer men were beginning to contend with.
