<pname>Tracy Letts</pname> was a celebrated playwright long before he became one of Hollywood’s most in-demand character actors. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for August: Osage County in 2008 and wrote numerous other hits like Bug, Man From Nebraska, and Superior Donuts, many of which premiered at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago.  But 2017 was a banner year for <pname>Letts</pname> on the film-acting front, given his notable roles in two major Oscar contenders. In <pname>Greta Gerwig</pname>’s coming-of-age movie <pname>Lady Bird</pname>, <pname>Letts</pname> gives a quiet, affecting performance as the title character’s father, <pname>Larry McPherson</pname>, a computer programmer struggling to find a job in the year 2002. <pname>Larry</pname> serves as an even-handed conciliator between his tempestuous daughter <pname>Lady Bird</pname> (<pname>Saoirse Ronan</pname>) and his equally strong-willed wife <pname>Marion</pname> (<pname>Laurie Metcalf</pname>). <pname>Letts</pname> is also in The Post, <pname>Steven Spielberg</pname>’s account of how the Washington Post publisher <pname>Katharine “Kay” Graham</pname> (<pname>Meryl Streep</pname>) and the executive editor <pname>Ben Bradlee</pname> (<pname>Tom Hanks</pname>) covered the Pentagon Papers in 1971. <pname>Letts</pname> plays <pname>Fritz Beebe</pname>, <pname>Graham</pname>’s trusted adviser, who’s a similarly steadying force in the film’s most pivotal scene. The Atlantic talked to <pname>Letts</pname> by phone about taking part in two of the most acclaimed movies of the year, the different atmospheres on <pname>Gerwig</pname> and <pname>Spielberg</pname>’s sets, and what it was like to work with his wife <pname>Carrie Coon</pname> (The Leftovers, Fargo) on screen for the first time in The Post. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. <pname>David Sims</pname>: When you’re looking for projects, is it the script that speaks to you more or the artists you could be collaborating with? I assume, with your stage work and writing, that it takes something more special to pull you onto a movie set.
