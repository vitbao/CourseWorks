Relating the experiences of your teenage years is both a universal and deeply personal effort. Cinema is littered with this, but it’s rare that you really connect with the filmmaker telling the tale in such a way. This week, that happens to be the case when Lady Bird opens. The baby of multi hyphenate <pname>Greta Gerwig</pname>, it’s one of the year’s very best films. Essentially, this is a coming of age classic in the making. You don’t need to be a teenage girl, past or present, to appreciate what <pname>Gerwig</pname> has done here. Not only is she a talented actress and writer, she’s now showcasing just how strong a director she is. You’ll be blown away.

Set in Northern California during the early 2000’s, the movie follows high school senior <pname>Christine ‘Lady Bird’ McPherson</pname> (<pname>Saoirse Ronan</pname>) as she fights with her strong willed mother <pname>Marion</pname> (<pname>Laurie Metcalf</pname>), goes about the final year of school, and plans on moving to New York for college. That urge is despised by <pname>Marion</pname>, though quietly supported by her father <pname>Larry</pname> (<pname>Tracy Letts</pname>). Lady Bird spends her days hanging out with best friend <pname>Julie</pname> (<pname>Beanie Feldstein</pname>), flirts with <pname>Danny</pname> (<pname>Lucas Hedges</pname>), and lusts after <pname>Kyle</pname> (<pname>Timothée Chalamet</pname>). Sacramento is where she calls home, but her heart is set on moving east, regardless of her mother’s wishes. That’s just the barest bones of it all, but the fun is in seeing these characters all evolve. It’s an absolute delight. <pname>Gerwig</pname> writes and directs. <pname>Sam Levy</pname> handles the cinematography, while the score comes to us from <pname>Jon Brion</pname>.
