When <pname>Mike Nichols</pname>’s low-budget comedy-drama The Graduate premiered in December 1967, it arrived during a time of national unrest. Many Baby Boomers were pushing back against the status quo: The military draft and the escalation of the war in Vietnam, combined with movements calling for civil rights and women’s liberation, prompted students and activists to protest the political and social establishment of the time. For those Boomers feeling alienated from their parents’ generation, The Graduate mirrored their disillusionment via a more personal, rather than ideologically charged, story. Adapted from what was then a little-known novel of the same name by <pname>Charles Webb</pname>, the coming-of-age film follows 21-year-old <pname>Benjamin Braddock</pname> (<pname>Dustin Hoffman</pname>) as he finishes college and struggles to find purpose in a world of meaningless consumption. Uncertain about his future, <pname>Benjamin</pname> embarks on an empty affair with an older woman—Mrs. <pname>Robinson</pname> (<pname>Anne Bancroft</pname>)—while desperately pursuing her daughter, <pname>Elaine</pname> (<pname>Katharine Ross</pname>). The Graduate quickly became a hit after its release (grossing $104.9 million on a $3 million budget) and garnered several Oscar nominations, including one for Best Picture.
