 “Submission” tells a tale of the dangers of temptation, and some viewers may have trouble avoiding the temptation to treat it as an op-ed rather than a work of imagination. Even though it’s based on a book published 18 years ago, and draws inspiration from a film from 1930 (itself based on a 1905 novel), the timeliness of this movie, written and directed by <pname>Richard Levine</pname>, might strike you as downright unnerving. A middle-aged writer teaching at a liberal-arts college <pname>Ted</pname>’s inevitable and dramatic flapping all the more terrible and amusing to witness. He is a charming guy, to be sure, but also smug and self-pitying. Whether or not he entirely deserves what he eventually gets, his complacency and passivity set him up for a fall. But “Submission” isn’t just his story. <pname>Angela</pname> is in many ways more interesting, even though, at the end, her motives are flattened in the interest of a narrative payoff. <pname>Ted</pname> is taken with her writing, and also with her naïve, admiring eagerness for his approval. She writes about sex with older men, in her novel and in an earlier book of poems, in a way that seems calculated to trigger inappropriate fantasies in the mind of a creatively frustrated, self-consciously aging teacher marooned in academia. <pname>Ted</pname> is an easy mark, and hardly an unwilling participant in his own ruin. He is less pathetic than the professor played by <pname>Emil Jannings</pname> in <pname>Josef von Sternberg</pname>’s “The Blue Angel” (which serves as both a model for “Submission” and point of reference within it), and <pname>Angela</pname> is hardly a siren in the mold of <pname>Marlene Dietrich</pname>’s cabaret singer. But <pname>Angela</pname> does turn out to be amoral, manipulative and dishonest, traits that make her both a caricature of feminine guile and a promising fiction writer — perhaps more fully committed to the art than her vain, bumbling teacher. Unfortunately, Mr. <pname>Levine</pname>, directing his second feature after working mainly in television (on “Masters of Sex” and “Nip/Tuck,” among other series), is a lesser artist than Ms. <pname>Prose</pname>. “Submission” feels more like an act of devotion, or perhaps of submission, than a free-standing adaptation. The satire is cautious and the emotions restrained, so that what should be a swirl of lust, ambition, recrimination and bureaucratic absurdity rises only to genteel, nervous laughter and mild discomfort. The actors all do their best — Ms. <pname>Timlin</pname> manages the difficult trick of switching back and forth between innocence and its opposite — but a crucial element of intensity is missing. By the end, the stakes seem trivial, even though families and livelihoods are in play and big ideas hover in the background. Can a movie be provocatively timid? Clumsy and coy at the same time? The more you think about “Submission,” the less relevant it looks. Which may represent a pyrrhic kind of vindication. There’s nothing here that’s really worth arguing about.
