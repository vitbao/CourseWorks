Senate Democrats say part of the caucus has serious concerns about a bipartisan immigration compromise, underscoring the uphill path for the proposal to get 60 votes. "I'm telling you, there are people with serious issues over this compromise," Sen. <pname>Dick Durbin</pname>    (Ill.), the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told reporters Wednesday after a closed-door caucus meeting. A bipartisan group, led by Republican Sen. <pname>Susan Collins</pname>    (Maine), clinched an agreement that would protect immigrants brought into the country illegally as children in exchange for roughly $25 billion in border security.  While it wouldn't touch the State Department's diversity visa lottery, senators — speaking to reporters while carrying around text of the legislation — said it would prevent "Dreamers" from sponsoring a parent who knowingly brought them into the country illegally.  <pname>Durbin</pname> said the fate of the parents and funding for a controversial U.S.-Mexico border wall are two sticking point viewed by some members of the Democratic caucus as "unacceptable."  "We're not there yet. We still have to solidify our caucus," he said, asked if the bipartisan group's proposal had the support to pass.  If the immigration deal can win over every Democrat — which is not guaranteed — supporters would need to win over 11 Republicans to overcome a 60-vote threshold.  "Look, we won't know until we get to the floor and get to a final vote if this gets 60. ... There are a number of strong concerns among Democrats about the concessions," said Sen. <pname>Christopher Coons</pname>    (D-Del.).  Asked as he was leaving the caucus meeting if the deal could pass, Senate Minority Leader <pname>Charles Schumer</pname>    (D-N.Y.) turned toward reporters and appeared to be about to say something, before ultimately walking away.
