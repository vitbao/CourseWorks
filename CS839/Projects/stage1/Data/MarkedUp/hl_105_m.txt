It exists! After complete radio silence all year long, the latest <pname>Paul Thomas Anderson</pname> outing, rumored to be the final on screen turn for star <pname>Daniel Day-Lewis</pname>, has revealed itself in a very notable way. Earlier today we got a first Trailer for Phantom Thread, the second collaboration between the two (after the award winning There Will Be Blood, of course). Now that its existence can be confirmed, we can start considering it as a potential major Academy Award player. We’ll have the Trailer for you at the end of the article, but first…you know what has to happen. We have to discuss it a bit beforehand. Onward!
The movie has been shrouded in secrecy, though a few days ago a detailed plot synopsis was released, which I’ll share now: “Set in the glamour of 1950s post-war London, renowned dressmaker <pname>Reynolds Woodcock</pname> (<pname>Daniel Day-Lewis</pname>) and his sister <pname>Cyril</pname> (<pname>Lesley Manville</pname>) are at the center of British fashion, dressing royalty, movie stars, heiresses, socialites, debutants and dames with the distinct style of The House of Woodcock. Women come and go through Woodcock’s life, providing the confirmed bachelor with inspiration and companionship, until he comes across a young, strong-willed woman, <pname>Alma</pname> (<pname>Vicky Krieps</pname>), who soon becomes a fixture in his life as his muse and lover. Once controlled and planned, he finds his carefully tailored life disrupted by love. With his latest film, <pname>Paul Thomas Anderson</pname> paints an illuminating portrait both of an artist on a creative journey, and the women who keep his world running. Phantom Thread is <pname>Paul Thomas Anderson</pname>’s eighth movie, and his second collaboration with <pname>Daniel Day-Lewis</pname>.” <pname>Anderson</pname> writes, directs, and handles the cinematography here, while other supporting players include <pname>Camilla Rutherford</pname>, among plenty more. <pname>Jonny Greenwood</pname> contributes the score.
Judging by the Trailer, this film, from the look of it, could be PTA’s tenderest outing yet. It’s a love story, crafted within the world of high fashion. Initial rumors had it resembling a <pname>Mike Leigh</pname> work, while others claimed it was a classy Fifty Shades of Grey type picture. Neither quite seems to fit, but then again, when can you easily put <pname>Anderson</pname> into any sort of a box? The main thing people will grab on to is if this is actually <pname>Day-Lewis</pname>’ swan song. If so, there could be temptation to reward him one more time with an Academy Award. More on that in a moment, but <pname>Gary Oldman</pname> may have found his primary competition this year in Best Actor.

Oscar may just eat this one up in a big way. At worst, you have to think Phantom Thread will be a player for DDL. That being said, an across the board campaign is going to be launched, including Best Picture, Best Director (for <pname>Anderson</pname>), Best Actor (for <pname>Day-Lewis</pname>), Best Actress (for <pname>Krieps</pname>, unless she goes Supporting), Best Supporting Actress (for <pname>Manville</pname> and/or <pname>Krieps</pname>, depending on category placement), Best Original Screenplay (for <pname>Anderson</pname> as well), Best Production Design, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Score. There’s a day where this flick could get double digit nominations. That might be a long shot, but it seems foolish to shut it out. The appeal to voters will be there.
You can see the Trailer for Phantom Thread below, though keep in mind that it’s going to be one of the final films to screen before the end of the year. A limited release is scheduled for Christmas Day, so unless it goes to a late film festival like AFI, it will be months before we fully know what to make of it. If nothing else, the movie can now start to percolate in the minds of both prognosticators as well as voters. <pname>Anderson</pname> and <pname>Day-Lewis</pname> are always contenders, so there’s no reason to expect anything less with this second pairing between the two. Time will tell, but this will be a cinematic event, one way or the other…
Here now, without further delay, is the Trailer for Phantom Thread:

Stay tuned for more on Phantom Thread between now and its release at the end of December!
