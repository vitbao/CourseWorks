Since its premiere last month, Wonder has been touted as a “feel-good,” family-friendly movie for the holiday season. The film is based on the 2012 bestselling novel by <pname>R.J. Palacio</pname> and follows a boy who was born with a craniofacial condition known as Treacher Collins syndrome, which causes disfigurement. Ten-year-old <pname>Auggie Pullman</pname> (<pname>Jacob Tremblay</pname>) has had to undergo nearly 30 surgeries, and his mother (<pname>Julia Roberts</pname>) gave up working on her Ph.D. to care for him. Wonder begins with <pname>Auggie</pname> facing a new sort of challenge: entering fifth grade at a mainstream prep academy after being homeschooled his whole life. Wonder, both the book and the film, has received praise for being a nuanced tear-jerker about a difficult subject. The story’s emphasis on the value of empathy has resonated with many educators, parents, and children, while the struggles of its main character have spurred a greater awareness of craniofacial conditions, which affect the formation of the skull and face. After the novel was published, the Children’s Craniofacial Association ordered thousands of special-edition copies with its own logo to use as teaching tools. Wonder is, in short, one of the most popular modern stories about what it’s like to live with a facial difference. And yet, in many ways, it isn’t really about disfigurement, or even primarily about <pname>Auggie</pname> himself.
