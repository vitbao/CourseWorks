The embargo has finally lifted, ladies and gentlemen! We can at long last discuss The Post, the new <pname>Steven Spielberg</pname> film, starring <pname>Tom Hanks</pname> and <pname>Meryl Streep</pname>. Yes, this super fast tracked project is not only complete, but has been screening pretty consistently for critics, guild members, and the Academy itself. The National Board of Review fell in love with it, and plenty of other voters are about to. We’re a month or so away from release still, but the buzz is building in a big way. Once again, <pname>Spielberg</pname> has delivered the goods. No one in the industry makes it look as easy as he does. He truly is a master at work.

<pname>Spielberg</pname> gets to tweak <pname>Donald Trump</pname> and do his own version of Spotlight here. Think that film mixed with the Bridge of Spies aesthetic and you more or less have The Post. It’s not a home run, but it’s rock solid and entertaining in a way that the master seems to do effortlessly. It also marks great roles for <pname>Hanks</pname> and <pname>Streep</pname>, with the former having a blast clearly and the latter getting to really showcase her ample talents by the end. A slightly sluggish beginning hurts things, but it wraps up like gangbusters. That’s just one reason it’s going to play quite well to the Academy and its membership, and already has started.
