Over the next month, The Atlantic’s “And, Scene” series will delve into some of the most interesting films of the year by examining a single, noteworthy moment and unpacking what it says about 2017. Next up is <pname>David Gordon Green</pname>’s Stronger. (Read our previous entries here.) By 10 minutes into Stronger, <pname>Jeff Bauman</pname>’s (<pname>Jake Gyllenhaal</pname>) legs are gone. They’ve been amputated above the knee, his parents are told, because of the damage he sustained in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, a terror attack that killed three and injured hundreds of others. As <pname>Bauman</pname>’s mother <pname>Patty</pname> (<pname>Miranda Richardson</pname>) comes into the hospital and sees her son for the first time, the director <pname>David Gordon Green</pname> holds on her heartbreaking stare for as long as possible. In doing so, he’s conveying everything the audience needs to know through another person’s empathetic reaction, rather than through the more distressing sight of <pname>Bauman</pname>’s wounded body.
