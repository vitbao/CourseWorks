Over the next month, The Atlantic’s “And, Scene” series will delve into some of the most interesting films of the year by examining a single, noteworthy moment and unpacking what it says about 2017. Next up is <pname>Sean Baker</pname>’s The Florida Project. (Read our previous entries here.) The Magic Castle Inn & Suites in Kissimmee, Florida, is not quite as enchanting as its fairytale namesake one town over in Orlando’s Disney World. Its bright purple exterior is somewhere between kitsch and outright eyesore, and its inhabitants are an unpredictable bunch. “The man in there gets arrested a lot,” 6-year-old <pname>Moonee</pname> (<pname>Brooklynn Prince</pname>) explains to a friend as she shows her around the building. “This woman thinks she’s married to <pname>Jesus</pname>.” <pname>Moonee</pname> and her young mother <pname>Halley</pname> (<pname>Bria Vinaite</pname>) live a tough life in one of the Magic Castle’s motel rooms. They’re part of the country’s “hidden homeless,” people (often single parents and children) who have a temporary roof over their heads but no longer-term housing of their own.
