Well, that’s more like it. As someone who has written at some length about the decline of Pixar Animation Studios since its acquisition by Disney, I am especially pleased to be proven wrong, even if only intermittently. The studio’s latest release, Coco, is one such occasion. Though Pixar has never acknowledged as much publicly, its cinematic philosophy (and business model) has shifted notably: Where the studio once aspired to excellence with every single picture—Pixar president <pname>Ed Catmull</pname> wrote an entire book expressing this ideal, Creativity, Inc.—it now seems content to roll out a few profitable, hyper-merchandise-friendly sequels for every genuinely original feature it unveils. (To put it another way, the studio has shifted away from “creativity” and toward “inc.”) But if Finding Dory and Cars 3 are the price we must pay for a film such as Coco, then so be it. Pixar’s latest is up there with Inside Out among the studio’s best features in years—less complex than <pname>Pete Docter</pname>’s 2015 film, but perhaps a tad more emotionally resonant. <pname>Miguel Rivera</pname> (<pname>Anthony Gonzalez</pname>) is a 12-year-old boy in Mexico whose greatest desire in life is to be a musician like his idol, the mid-century legend <pname>Ernesto de la Cruz</pname> (<pname>Benjamin Bratt</pname>). Alas, <pname>Miguel</pname>’s great-great-grandmother was abandoned by her musician husband, and the <pname>Rivera</pname> family has enforced an iron-clad policy against music ever since. Instead, each subsequent generation has gone into the family business of making shoes. (Shades of <pname>Hermey</pname>, the toy-making elf who wished to become a dentist.)
