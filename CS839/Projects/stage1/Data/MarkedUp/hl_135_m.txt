Sometimes, a movie just hits at the right time. Battle of the Sexes, initially just a baity biopic of <pname>Billie Jean King</pname> and the moment where he path crossed with <pname>Bobby Riggs</pname>, is now about so much more. Obviously, it’s a comedic sports tale as well, but it’s also in many ways a re litigation of the 2016 Presidential election between <pname>Hillary Clinton</pname> and <pname>Donald Trump</pname>. Apolitical audiences will enjoy things besides that, but if that’s still on your mind, you’ll be incredibly moved by this one. This week, Battle of the Sexes hits theaters and serves up (no pun intended) a real good time at the movies. 
The film is a look at a pivotal moment in the fight for equality between the genders. In 1973, ex-champ and hustler <pname>Bobby Riggs</pname> (<pname>Steve Carell</pname>) was looking to get back in the spotlight, so he challenged women’s World number one tennis player <pname>Billie Jean King</pname> (<pname>Emma Stone</pname>) to a match. <pname>Riggs</pname> adopted a chauvinistic persona, rallying men to his cause. <pname>King</pname> initially resists him, while also beginning to explore her sexuality with hairdresser <pname>Marilyn Barnett</pname> (<pname>Andrea Riseborough</pname>). When <pname>King</pname> initially rebuffs <pname>Riggs</pname>, he plays another female player in Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee) and beats her, backing <pname>King</pname> into a corner. Soon after, the “Battle of the Sexes” is on. History tells you who wins, but there’s genuine emotion in seeing it happen. 

This movie is supremely entertaining. Even if you don’t care about politics, it works as a behind the scenes type sports flick. If you’re political though, this has a wonderful extra layer to it. <pname>Riggs</pname> is proto <pname>Trump</pname>, and <pname>Carell</pname> certainly plays him as such, at least under the surface. <pname>King</pname> works well as a <pname>Clinton</pname> stand in too, with <pname>Stone</pname>’s expert performance suggesting but never calling overt attention to that. This is a really well made flick, one that will give many audience members the feeling of finally getting to see the result they wish they had gotten back in November of last year. Remove that all and you still have something top notch. It’s just that added layer which might help it really appeal to Academy members.

This weekend, audiences of all sorts will be able to see Battle of the Sexes, as it starts its potential march to Oscar glory. <pname>Stone</pname> seems likely to return to Academy contention, while the film itself might end up being a true threat in Best Picture. Whether it can actually contend to win remains to be seen, but the movie is really good, independent of all that. It’s one of the ten best things I’ve seen so far this year, so take it as pretty high praise. Give it a look and follow along as it holds court in the awards season as 2017 progresses…
Be sure to check out Battle of the Sexes, beginning its theatrical run on Friday!
