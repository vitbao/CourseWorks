“What do you do around here?” the tall, strapping <pname>Oliver</pname> (<pname>Armie Hammer</pname>) asks <pname>Elio</pname> (<pname>Timothée Chalamet</pname>), the 17-year-old giving him a tour of the charming Italian village where <pname>Oliver</pname> will be living for the next six weeks. “Wait for the summer to end,” the bored-seeming <pname>Elio</pname> says with a sigh. “And what do you do in the winter? Wait for the summer to come?” <pname>Oliver</pname> shoots back. That only gets a chuckle from <pname>Elio</pname>, but that line nails the initial mood of Call Me by Your Name, <pname>Luca Guadagnino</pname>’s sumptuous new romance, which follows a deep connection that springs out of those restless days of late adolescence. <pname>Elio</pname> is the intelligent, charming son of archeology professor <pname>Samuel Perlman</pname> (<pname>Michael Stuhlbarg</pname>), with whom <pname>Oliver</pname>, a graduate student, is interning for the summer. <pname>Guadagnino</pname>’s film, based on the 2007 novel by <pname>André Aciman</pname>, charts <pname>Elio</pname> and <pname>Oliver</pname>’s relationship, which develops haltingly at first but then burns brightly.
