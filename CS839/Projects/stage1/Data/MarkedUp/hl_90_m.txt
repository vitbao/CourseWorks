Over the years, no one has quite captured the feeling of just spending time with friends on the big screen like<pname>Richard Linklater</pname> has. It’s an amazing skill for which he doesn’t quite get the credit he deserves. Yes, he’s feted often and this skill is mentioned, but to be able to do it like he does is really something. This week, and today, actually, audiences can see <pname>Linklater</pname> once again chronicle individuals just spending time with each other, as Last Flag Flying is being released. This is a terrific movie, among the best of the year. <pname>Linklater</pname> has done it again. He’s on quite the run lately, between this, Everybody Wants Some, and of course, Boyhood.


I’ll reiterate much of what I said about movie back when I saw it as the Opening Night selection of the 2017 New York Film Festival: I cried on multiple occasions during this one. Last Flag Flying represents one of <pname>Linklater</pname>’s most mature works to date, and one of his best too. <pname>Carell</pname> and <pname>Cranston</pname> have never been better, while <pname>Fishburne</pname> is terrific too. <pname>Tyson</pname> kills it in her one scene, while <pname>Linklater</pname> proves very adept at middle aged male bonding dynamics. It’s often a heartbreaking picture, though a very funny one as well. <pname>Carell</pname> will undoubtedly make you cry, while <pname>Cranston</pname> will make you howl with laughter. In fact, he’s very much channeling <pname>Jack Nicholson</pname> here. It’s impressive work on all fronts. NYFF had another strong Opening Night Selection on their hands with this one. This flick is a winner.

Starting today, Last Flag Flying is opening in limited release, and it’s a must see. If you’re a <pname>Linklater</pname> fan, this will both feel like something new from him, as well as recognizably his own work. It’s his most mature hang out movie to date. Plus, <pname>Carell</pname> is turning in career best work, with <pname>Cranston</pname> not far behind. You’ll laugh and cry in equal measure, and that’s the mark of a special film. Whether we see Oscar take a shine to this one or not, it continues a strong run of late for <pname>Linklater</pname>, something that should only continue with his next flick, the adaptation of Where’d You Go, Bernadette. Look for that one next year, but head out to see his latest as soon as possible. You’ll thank me afterwards…
Be sure to check out Last Flag Flying, in theaters now!
