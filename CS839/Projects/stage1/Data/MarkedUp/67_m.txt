As usual, <pname>Tom Hardy</pname> is playing a movie character with a troubled past. In Sony’s Venom, <pname>Tom</pname> chooses an exciting new accent, climbs onto a motorcycle, and breaks down under the strain of some intense trauma. Venom’s a classic Spider-Man villain slash anti-hero, who gets his powers thanks to some nasty alien symbiote that <pname>Riz Ahmed</pname>’s character seems to be studying. <pname>Michelle Williams</pname> is also there in the sad–<pname>Michelle Williams</pname>–ex role. Venom premieres this October, expect sadness and lots of rain.
