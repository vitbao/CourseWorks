What if <pname>Zac Efron</pname>, a pop-culture icon you know and love, got ridiculously grimy? This is the brave question <pname>Harmony Korine</pname>, director of Spring Breakers, dares to ask in his new film The Beach Bum. In it, he plays a character named “<pname>Flicker</pname>” alongside <pname>Matthew McConaughey</pname>, <pname>Isla Fisher</pname>, <pname>Jimmy Buffett</pname>, and <pname>Snoop Dogg</pname>. <pname>McConaughey</pname> is a stoner named “<pname>Moondog</pname>,” who apparently meets <pname>Flicker</pname> somewhere in the movie — at some other point, he also rides around on a hoverboard eating lobster, because <pname>Harmony Korine</pname> has never resisted the urge to be over the top. From the looks of these photos of a costumed <pname>Zac Efron</pname>, they get very, very high together — maybe go dumpster diving? — and probably commit homicide and never tell anyone about it.

We’re a long way from circus musicals.
