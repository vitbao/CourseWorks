Over the next month, The Atlantic’s “And, Scene” series will delve into some of the most interesting films of the year by examining a single, noteworthy moment and unpacking what it says about 2017. Next up is <pname>Greta Gerwig</pname>’s <pname>Lady Bird</pname>. (Read our previous entries here.) There’s an appreciable freneticism to <pname>Lady Bird</pname>, <pname>Greta Gerwig</pname>’s wonderful coming-of-age dramedy about a 17-year-old girl (<pname>Saoirse Ronan</pname>) growing up in Sacramento, California, in 2002. The film shuffles from scene to scene with jazzy abruptness, bottling an entire senior year in high school (and the early moments of freshman year in college) into a 95-minute running time. Life-changing events for this protagonist (her father losing his job, acceptance into college, the loss of her virginity) bump up against funnier, more inconsequential ones; it’s one of the most authentic depictions of that tumultuous period on the cusp of adulthood I’ve ever seen in a film. The memories are all there, but <pname>Lady Bird</pname> (real name <pname>Christine</pname>, but she’s adopted a more interesting nom de plume) won’t really be able to sort through them all for years to come.
