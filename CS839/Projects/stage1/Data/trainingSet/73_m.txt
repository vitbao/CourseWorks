When New York Times critic <pname>Wesley Morris</pname> launched a pointed argument about awards-season villain Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, a surprising figure was lurking the comments section. “I loved this movie, and intend to see it again,” the commenter wrote. “My son, <pname>Sam</pname>, won a Golden Globe for playing <pname>Jason Dixon</pname>. I think I would still love the movie if another actor had played <pname>Dixon</pname> … But not quite as much.” What? On Jimmy Kimmel Live! <pname>Sam Rockwell</pname> confirmed the commenter was indeed his dad, <pname>Pete Rockwell</pname>. Good lookin’ out.
