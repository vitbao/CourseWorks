Over the next month, The Atlantic’s “And, Scene” series will delve into some of the most interesting films of the year by examining a single, noteworthy moment and unpacking what it says about 2017. Next up is <pname>Darren Aronofsky</pname>’s mother! (Read our previous entries here.) Halfway through mother!, the unnamed woman played by <pname>Jennifer Lawrence</pname> comes downstairs to any homeowner’s worst nightmare: uninvited guests. Dressed in black, they start pouring into her sparsely decorated country mansion without even knocking on the door. “They had nowhere to go, so I told them it would be all right to invite some friends and family,” says <pname>Lawrence</pname>’s husband (<pname>Javier Bardem</pname>, whose character, like everyone else in the film, is unnamed). The crowd grows, and the funeral they arrived for devolves into a lively wake, then into an all-out house party. Though it was a financial flop and seems unlikely to win any major awards, mother! may have a cinematic legacy that eclipses some of 2017’s biggest successes. I came away from my viewing of it with mixed feelings, and yet I can’t deny that the movie was one of the most memorable pieces of cinema this year—both in terms of its storytelling confidence and the charged debates over its meaning that it sparked among viewers. While I found the extended, cacophonous conclusion of mother! off-putting in its obviousness, I haven’t been able to shake my love for the quieter, dreamlike first half, which culminates in a sequence centered on one very special kitchen fixture: a sink.
