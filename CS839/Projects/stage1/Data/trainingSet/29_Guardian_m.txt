<pname>Greta Gerwig</pname>’s film packs in John Hughes-style teenage angst. But its focus on self-determination and female bonds – rather than validation by boyfriend – sets it apart

The teen movie is an often raucous affair: embryonic sexual stirrings, combative parent/child relationships and the heart-tugging turbulence of post-adolescent friendship – which is why it is surprising to find <pname>Greta Gerwig</pname>’s directorial debut, Lady Bird, such a quiet and understated film. But there is perhaps something about <pname>Gerwig</pname>’s delicacy of touch that lends clarity to one of the film’s most resounding themes: its unapologetic feminism.The central character (<pname>Saoirse Ronan</pname>) – unsatisfied with her comparatively drab given name, <pname>Christine</pname> – precociously assumes the alias Lady Bird. She dresses in thrift-shop clothes, has clumsily dyed pink hair and dreams of leaving what she deems the cultural wasteland of Sacramento, California, and her claustrophobic Catholic high-school – to study at a pricey liberal arts college on the US east coast.Lady Bird is in many ways a feminist recalibration of the sort of genre tropes associated with the teen film. It seemingly has more in common with <pname>John Hughes</pname>’s hormonal outings in the 1980s than the 90s second wave (Clueless, 10 Things I Hate About You), or even more contemporary takes on the genre (Easy A, The To Do List). Lady Bird has something of the everydayness of <pname>Molly Ringwald</pname>’s various incarnations – minus the ramped-up passivity and recursive romantic trajectories that freighted many of <pname>Hughes</pname>’s films. Lady Bird has two love interests: <pname>Danny</pname> (<pname>Lucas Hedges</pname>), a sweet fellow-member of her school’s drama programme and <pname>Kyle</pname> (<pname>Timothée Chalamet</pname>), a disaffected musician of <pname>Jordan Catalano</pname> proportions. She breaks up with the former after discovering him making out with a boy in a toilet cubicle, and tires of the latter on seeing through his calculated pseudo-rebel persona.Lady Bird's virginity is not symbolic of failure to engage with life … she does not structure her identity around sexLady Bird regards neither romantic breakdown as a treatise on her general worth: how she values herself is almost entirely self-determined, a bullish sense of her potential. She comforts <pname>Danny</pname> on his struggle to come out, pressing his head to her chest and tenderly raking through his hair – an instinct to nurture men perhaps inherited from her mother, who tiptoes around her father as he struggles with depression. On learning <pname>Kyle</pname> is not a virgin (though he insinuated he was), after first having sex with him (or anyone), she exclaims: “I was on top! Who the fuck is on top their first time!” Virginity is often a preoccupation in Hughes’s films, and notably for Ringwald’s characters – but unlike in The Breakfast Club or Sixteen Candles, <pname>Lady Bird</pname>’s virginity is not symbolic of her failure to engage with life, nor her apparent innocence; like her short-lived relationships with men, sex is not something she structures her identity around, rather a thing that happens.<pname>Lady Bird</pname>’s more romantic subplot comes from her relationship with her best friend <pname>Julie</pname>: <pname>Julie</pname> and <pname>Lady Bird</pname> drift apart following <pname>Lady Bird</pname>’s dalliance with a more popular girl, a relationship that is severed when she makes a cruel comment at the expense of <pname>Julie</pname>’s mother. Teen films often reinforce the notion women can only find fulfilment via a conventional heterosexual coupling, usually advanced by the man. Lady Bird subverts that, and the film’s romantic apex is found in <pname>Lady Bird</pname> and <pname>Julie</pname>’s reconciliation. <pname>Lady Bird</pname> ditches <pname>Kyle</pname> and the cool girl en-route to the prom to return to <pname>Julie</pname>: they slow-dance under pastel-coloured streamers then walk home holding their shoes.But Lady Bird’s most significant relationship is surely with her mother <pname>Marion</pname>: the roundly wonderful <pname>Laurie Metcalf</pname>. Maternal love is depicted with a necessary brutality: <pname>Marion</pname> perpetually chastises <pname>Lady Bird</pname>, telling her she’s unlikely to get into the east-coast college of her dreams on account of her poor work ethic and bad grades. (<pname>Lady Bird</pname> throws herself out of a moving car in response.) It is understood she is fostering in her daughter the grit and resolve required to exist in the world, a strength she vividly inhabits. And <pname>Lady Bird</pname>, with her steely sense of a right to exist and an entitlement to pursue her ambitions, seems not to have fallen too far from the tree. <pname>Lady Bird</pname> makes it to college in New York: at a party a co-ed asks her name, and after a pause, she answers: “<pname>Christine</pname>.”
