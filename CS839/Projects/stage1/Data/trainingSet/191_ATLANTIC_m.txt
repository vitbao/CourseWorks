In cinema, as elsewhere, there can be too much of a good thing. Quick: Do you remember the film several years back that starred <pname>Judi Dench</pname>, <pname>Penélope Cruz</pname>, <pname>Daniel Day-Lewis</pname>, <pname>Marion Cotillard</pname>, and <pname>Nicole Kidman</pname>, among others? If you recall that it was Nine, the director <pname>Rob Marshall</pname>’s musical follow-up to his Academy Award–winning Chicago, well good on you. I can scarcely summon any memory of the film myself. The director <pname>Kenneth Branagh</pname>’s remake of Murder on the Orient Express labors under the same delusion that cinematic quality is arithmetical: <pname>Dench</pname> and <pname>Cruz</pname> are both here again, as are <pname>Branagh</pname> himself, <pname>Michelle Pfeiffer</pname>, <pname>Johnny Depp</pname>, <pname>Daisy Ridley</pname>, <pname>Josh Gad</pname>, <pname>Derek Jacobi</pname>, and God knows how many others who are currently skipping my mind. If movies truly were math, this would be a masterpiece. But they aren’t, and it’s not. <pname>Branagh</pname>’s retelling of the classic <pname>Agatha Christie</pname> tale is visually sumptuous yet otherwise inert, a series of what are essentially cameos by performers far too gifted to waste their time like this. There should be a law against casting <pname>Judi Dench</pname> in a film and then giving her virtually nothing to do.
