When Star Wars: The Force Awakens hit theaters two years ago, my reaction to it—like that of many people—had two distinct phases: initial elation (it’s erased all signs of the prequels!); and, later, mild disappointment at the over-reliance on nostalgia and recyclings from the first trilogy (another Death Star?). This was always going to be a tricky balance—long-awaited fan fulfillment versus something genuinely fresh—and I suggested at the time that final judgment on the movie would depend in part on its sequels: If they branched out in new directions, The Force Awakens’s flaws would be easily forgiven; if, on the other hand, “we again find our heroes lassoing AT-ATs on a snow-covered planet”—à la The Empire Strikes Back—it would be a bad sign for the franchise. Well, the writer-director <pname>Rian Johnson</pname>’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi does feature another battle with AT-ATs on a snow-covered planet. Also: another Imperial/First Order effort to wipe out a rebel base with staggeringly powerful, space-based weapons; another subplot about a Jedi traveling to a distant planet to be mentored in the Force; another alien-filled cantina (actually, a casino this time around); another infiltration of an enemy vessel to turn off a crucial piece of hardware; another light-saber battle between former master and pupil; and a crucial scene that bears notable resemblance to the <pname>Luke</pname>-<pname>Vader</pname>-<pname>Emperor</pname> climax of Return of the Jedi. Yet <pname>Johnson</pname> tweaks these callbacks far more cunningly than his predecessor, <pname>J.J. Abrams</pname>, did his own in The Force Awakens: He flips their sequences, he toys with their meaning, and—in that crucial scene especially—he sets up certain expectations and then confounds them. Does the movie, like its predecessor, rely on familiar tropes a bit more than it should? Yes, I think it does. Is it, at a solid two-and-a-half hours, considerably longer than it needed to be? Yes, that too. But it’s still a pretty damn good movie, arguably the best the franchise has offered since Empire. The movie opens more or less where The Force Awakens left off. The young would-be Jedi, <pname>Rey</pname> (<pname>Daisy Ridley</pname>), has traveled to meet her first-trilogy counterpart, <pname>Luke Skywalker</pname> (<pname>Mark Hamill</pname>), on a craggy island on a faraway world. The question is whether he will agree to serve as her mentor in the Force, as <pname>Obi-Wan</pname> and <pname>Yoda</pname> served him way back when. Alas, bitter and scraggly-bearded, <pname>Luke</pname> initially responds with a variation of “Get the hell off my lawn, kid!” But <pname>Johnson</pname> ultimately has more interesting things in store for both of these characters, as well as for <pname>Kylo Ren</pname> (<pname>Adam Driver</pname>), the Darth <pname>Vader</pname> wannabe who has a complex and tortured history with <pname>Luke</pname>, and who spends a good portion of the film telepathically linked with <pname>Rey</pname>.
