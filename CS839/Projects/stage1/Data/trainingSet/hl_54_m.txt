Embargoing a film up until the day of release is never a sign of confidence on the part of a studio. Usually, this sort of treatment is reserved for low class genre fare, not would be Oscar contenders. Yet, here we are in the case of The Greatest Showman. It opens today and reviews were embargoed until just after midnight. 20th Century Fox has essentially been hiding it, hoping <pname>Hugh Jackman</pname>’s star power, the idea of a musical, and the three Golden Globe nominations (more on those in a bit) would drive traffic. They don’t have it on their For Your Consideration page, preferring instead to hitch their wagon to <pname>Jackman</pname>’s other outing Logan, among other things. A wise move for Fox, as this is one of the worst movies of the year.

The film is a musical biopic, looking at how <pname>Phineas Taylor Barnum</pname>, or <pname>P.T. Barnum</pname> (<pname>Jackman</pname>), essentially started the world of show business. Growing up poor, he won the heart of Charity (<pname>Michelle William</pname>s), but always felt the need to show her wealthy parents that he wasn’t trash. Even as an adult, when they have two young girls, he’s always looking to go bigger. Initially, it’s a museum of wax figures, but then, when he decides to feature what are essentially freaks, his star rises. Teaming up with a host of characters, as well as a producer in <pname>Phillip Carlyle</pname> (<pname>Zac Efron</pname>), the show becomes a literal circus, as coined by nonplussed theater critic <pname>James Gordon Bennett</pname> (<pname>Paul Sparkst</pname>). The rest is history.
