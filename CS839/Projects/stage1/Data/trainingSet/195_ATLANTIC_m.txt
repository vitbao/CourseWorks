There are plenty of advantages to getting hired to direct the next Marvel movie. You’re working with near-limitless resources, can hire Oscar-winning actors like <pname>Cate Blanchett</pname> and <pname>Tilda Swinton</pname> for supporting roles, and your film is essentially guaranteed to be one of the most watched of the year. Lately, the company has become more comfortable hiring idiosyncratic young talent, the best (and most recent) example being <pname>Taika Waititi</pname>, the director of Thor: Ragnarok. For Marvel, too, the benefits are clear. Filmmakers like <pname>Waititi</pname> can keep these never-ending sequels from feeling stale, while also attracting critical approval. But are the bonuses that come with Marvel’s largesse enough to combat the downsides of being part of a much bigger machine? <pname>Waititi</pname>, the New Zealander behind wonderfully offbeat comedies like What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, has been full of praise for the Marvel process during the Ragnarok press tour. In an interview with <pname>Sean Fennessey</pname> on The Ringer’s “Big Picture” podcast, he said the studio (which is owned by Disney) basically left him alone during filming, and that he encouraged improvisation and humor on set (which shines through in the finished product, as my colleague <pname>Christopher Orr</pname> noted in his review). Yes, <pname>Waititi</pname> allowed, Marvel had the movie’s major plot points set in stone and exerted a lot of control over the action sequences and visual effects. But the extent to which Thor: Ragnarok—the third Thor film and the 17th Marvel film overall—feels like a <pname>Taika Waititi</pname> movie is impressive.
