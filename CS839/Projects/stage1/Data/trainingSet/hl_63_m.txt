Another day, another embargo lifts for a high profile December release hoping to make an Oscar play. Today, it’s Phantom Thread, the second collaboration between filmmaker <pname>Paul Thomas Anderson</pname> and actor <pname>Daniel Day-Lewis</pname>. With <pname>Day-Lewis</pname> claiming that he’s retiring and that this is his final on screen appearance, the movie has an added bit of prestige to it. <pname>Anderson</pname> films always have that luster, but this classy outing doubles down on it. PTA and DDL made something special together last time around with There Will Be Blood. Since then, <pname>Anderson</pname> has challenged audiences with The Master and Inherent Vice, while <pname>Day-Lewis</pname> won another Academy Award with Lincoln. Able to speak freely, I must admit to being a bit puzzled by this new work. Still, it will generate plenty of discussion. 


Personally, this is a hard film to love. It’s easy to admire, with top notch performances, visuals, costume design, and a score to die for. That being said, it’s somewhat cold and impenetrable, which is problematic when doing a love story. <pname>Day-Lewis</pname> is more subdued than usual. She deserves to see her star rise. <pname>Anderson</pname> is experimenting here, no question about it. He just isn’t making anything that exciting. Honestly, I left my press screening a few weeks ago wanting more. Perhaps that’s just a case of overly heightened expectations? That’s a distinct possibility, I’ll concede that.
