When you’re as big a star as <pname>Denzel Washington</pname> is, you pretty much have your pick of the litter, project wise. As such, when a curveball is thrown by the actor, it’s worth noting. This week, <pname>Washington</pname> tackles something very different with <pname>Roman J. Israel</pname>, Esq. The film itself struggles, but <pname>Washington</pname> will be the focus. In fact, it wouldn’t be a surprise at all if Oscar decides that it’s worth yet another Best Actor nomination for the man. That will be the main curiosity here, as <pname>Washington</pname> always finds himself in contention, especially when it’s a showcase for his acting like this one seeks to be. 

This movie combines elements of a character study with elements of a legal thriller. In short, it follows title character <pname>Roman J. Israel</pname> (<pname>Washington</pname>) as he attempts to crusade for what’s right. A relic of the past to most, he sees his world upended when his law firm partner passes and he makes a rare financially motivated decision…going to work for <pname>George Pierce</pname> (<pname>Colin Farrell</pname>). With the glitzy world of expensive defense law showing him a “better” life, he also has the conscious of <pname>Maya Alston</pname> (<pname>Carmen Ejogo</pname>) in his head. The decisions he makes are ones best left for you to discover, but they come at a definite cost. <pname>Dan Gilroy</pname> writes and directs. Sibling <pname>John Gilroy</pname> edits, while the score is by <pname>James Newton Howard</pname>, and the cinematography comes from <pname>Robert Elswit</pname>.
