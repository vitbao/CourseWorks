“I write entirely to find out what I’m thinking, what I’m looking at, what I see and what it means,” <pname>Joan Didion</pname> confessed in 1976. “What I want and what I fear.” The writer was in one way taking preemptive credit—or, depending on your point of view, accepting the preemptive blame—for the explosion of personal essay-writing that, fueled by the internet and its egotisms, would later become known as the first-person industrial complex. <pname>Didion</pname>, with her faith in the moral worth of introspection—her conviction that understanding oneself operates on a continuum with the understanding of everything else—helped to inspire a generation of writers to remain, via acts of performative journaling, on nodding terms with the people they used to be. <pname>Didion</pname>’s writing, however, can be deceptive: It pulses with the heady warmth of confession, but in fact has extremely little patience for the indignities of aimless admission. <pname>Didion</pname>’s confessions are controlled, always, and extremely strategic about what they share and what they keep hidden from view. More than admitting, they imply—<pname>Montaigne</pname>, definitely, but also <pname>Monet</pname>: <pname>Didion</pname> is an essayist who is also an impressionist.
