Of all the movies to debut at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, none helped raise their stock more than I, Tonya. Initially thought of as little more than a question mark in the awards race, enthusiastic reviews have shot it into the stratosphere. Now, it’s a true contender, along with being one of the year’s best films. This week, I, <pname>Tonya</pname> opens and hopes to establish distributor Neon as the next A24, striking gold almost immediately. Not only could this prove to be a crossover hit, it seems very likely to be a legitimate Oscar player. Especially in Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, the picture is looking for a gold medal.

The film is a biopic of controversial figure skater <pname>Tonya Harding</pname> (<pname>Margot Robbie</pname>), who briefly capturing America’s attention in the 1990’s. Shot using occasional talking head interviews by the chief characters, we see <pname>Tonya</pname> rise up through the ranks of her sport, spurred on by her cruel mother <pname>LaVona Golden</pname> (<pname>Allison Janney</pname>) and abusive husband <pname>Jeff Gillooly</pname> (<pname>Sebastian Stan</pname>). Of course, all she’s worked for is challenged by the status quo in the sport, who doesn’t like her “white trash” upbringing, especially when “class” is the key word everywhere else in figure skating. Then, there’s the notable incident spurred on by <pname>Gillooly</pname> and his friend <pname>Shawn Eckhardt</pname> (<pname>Paul Walter Hauser</pname>), one that will result in an injury to <pname>Tonya</pname>'s main competition, <pname>Nancy Kerrigan</pname> (<pname>Caitlin Carver</pname>).

Awards wise, assuming new kid on the block Neon can avoid being shut out in part for being a fresh distributor, I, <pname>Tonya</pname> should be a minor force in the race. Look for the biggest Oscar effort to be in Best Picture, Best Actress (for <pname>Robbie</pname>), Best Supporting Actress (for <pname>Janney</pname>). Supporting Actress for <pname>Janney</pname> seems like a nomination lock at least, with the same more or less being said for <pname>Robbie</pname> in Actress. The rest will all depend on how the precursors continue to go for the flick.
