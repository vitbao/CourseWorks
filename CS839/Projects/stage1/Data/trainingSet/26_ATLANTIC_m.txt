Another year is upon us, as is another calendar of Hollywood projects, for better or for worse. From Black Panther to A Wrinkle in Time to the return of Mary Poppins, even 2018’s biggest film franchises feature exciting actors and creators, though there are also plenty of smaller projects hoping to be remembered by the end of the year. Here’s a look at some of 2018’s most notable movies. <pname>Carl Costas</pname> / AP The 15:17 to Paris (Feb. 9) What It Is: <pname>Clint Eastwood</pname>’s latest tale of true-life heroism after his back-to-back hits American Sniper and Sully. But this time, rather than casting a movie star like <pname>Tom Hanks</pname> or <pname>Bradley Cooper</pname>, <pname>Eastwood</pname> is filming the real-life heroes <pname>Spencer Stone</pname>, <pname>Anthony Sadler</pname>, and <pname>Alek Skarlatos</pname>, three Americans who helped stop a gunman on a French train in 2015. The trio will play themselves, with <pname>Judy Greer</pname>, <pname>Jenna Fischer</pname>, and <pname>Jaleel White</pname> making up this very unusual project’s ensemble.
