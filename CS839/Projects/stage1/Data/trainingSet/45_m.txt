The original Kung Fury is an extremely successful Kickstarter-funded short film from 2015 that pulled in more than $600,000 from the crowdfunding site and made its debut during the Directors’ Fortnight section of the Cannes Film Festival. Now, according to The Hollywood Reporter, it’s getting a feature-length sequel starring <pname>Michael Fassbender</pname>, who leads a police force called the Thundercops, can travel through space and time, and must defeat the “Kung Fuhrer” — yes, that’s <pname>Adolf Hitler</pname> — to rid the world of evil. It’s also set in Miami in 1985, so it’s a period piece of sorts, and like the short film, <pname>David Hasselhoff</pname> will also be making an appearance. <pname>David Sandberg</pname> will once again write and direct the full-length movie, just as he did the original Kickstarter project. And if he can land <pname>Fassbender</pname> in the lead, just imagine who they’ll pick up for the rest of the Thundercops.
