The Senate is barreling toward a showdown on the floor over immigration, with both sides digging in as they hunt for 60 votes. The battle could come to a head as soon as Thursday, with Majority Leader <pname>Mitch McConnell</pname>    (R-Ky.) urging lawmakers to move forward quickly. “At a minimum, under the regular order, we can make sure at least they receive a vote by Friday morning. I hope the Democratic leader will finally consent to hold these votes on amendments today,” he said. <pname>McConnell</pname> has teed up four proposals: A measure from Sens. <pname>Christopher Coons</pname>    (D-Del.) and <pname>John McCain</pname>    (R-Ariz.) dealing with "Dreamers" and border security, an amendment from Sen. <pname>Pat Toomey</pname>    (R-Pa.) cracking down on sanctuary cities, a bipartisan proposal from the Common Sense Coalition and a framework from the White House. Under Senate rules, the soonest the Senate can vote is early Friday morning, unless lawmakers agree to speed things up. No votes are currently scheduled. To overcome an initial procedural hurdle, any proposal would need to get 60 votes, meaning the support of both Republicans and Democrats. As of Thursday morning each of the four measures appeared short of that total, though lawmakers and the White House are scrambling to lock down support. Here’s what to watch for. How many votes can the centrist measure get? The centrist group, led by Sen. <pname>Susan Collins</pname>    (R-Maine), is working to win over wary members on both sides. Only eight Republican senators are on board with the proposal. If every Democratic senator supports it — which is not guaranteed — they would need at least 11 Republicans to get 60 votes. Sen. <pname>Jeff Flake</pname>    (R-Ariz.) told reporters he is working to whip votes for the plan. “We’re close,” he said on Thursday. The proposal includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children, often referred to as Dreamers. It also contains $25 billion for border security and narrow changes to family-based immigration. Several Republicans who backed a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 that was much more expansive, including Sens. <pname>Orrin Hatch</pname>    (Utah) and <pname>Dean Heller</pname>    (Nev.), have yet to say whether they will support the plan. A spokesman for <pname>Hatch</pname> said he is currently reviewing each of the proposals but "wants to support a proposal that not only can pass the House, but that can be signed into law by the President.” But Sen. <pname>Bob Corker</pname>    (R-Tenn.), who also voted for the 2013 bill, on Thursday said he would vote against the bipartisan proposal, dealing a blow to the effort. Meanwhile, the <pname>Trump</pname> administration is actively lobbying against the proposal, saying it will incentivize more illegal immigration and increase crime. In a statement Thursday, the White House said advisers would recommend that <pname>Trump</pname> veto the centrist bill if it reached his desk. “This Amendment would drastically change our national immigration policy for the worse by weakening border security and undercutting existing immigration law. … The Amendment would undermine the safety and security of American families and impede economic growth for American workers,” White House press secretary <pname>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</pname> said in a statement.  Underscoring the uphill path the amendment has, Sen. <pname>Dick Durbin</pname>    (D-Ill.) warned that some members of the Democratic caucus could also oppose the plan over money it contains for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and a provision that blocks Dreamers from sponsoring parents that knowingly brought them into the country illegally. "I'm telling you, there are people with serious issues over this compromise," Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said after a closed-door caucus meeting. If the bipartisan plan falls short of 60 votes, there’s a possibility that several Democrats — particularly those eying a run for the White House in 2020 — will end up voting against it. How much support will <pname>Trump</pname>'s "four pillars" plan get? <pname>Trump</pname>’s plan, spearheaded by Sen. <pname>Chuck Grassley</pname>    (R-Iowa), is widely expected to fall short of the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate. If every Republican backed the measure, which appears unlikely, <pname>Grassley</pname> would still need to win over at nine Democratic senators to reach 60.
