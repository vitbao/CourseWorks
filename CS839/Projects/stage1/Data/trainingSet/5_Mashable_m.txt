At any given moment, how close are any of us to committing an act as despicable as murder? What kind of circumstances could arise to push a person in that direction?
Those are questions The Push sets out to ask. The upcoming Netflix reality special stages an elaborate ruse in which a series of scripted events drive one unsuspecting man toward killing a living human.

A new trailer for the hour-long program, out Feb. 27, hints at the premise. There's a big-money auction happening, and one of the event's wealthy benefactors falls to the ground clutching his chest shortly before it begins.
<pname>Chris</pname>, the unwitting "star" of the program, is one of two participants who's there when it happens. He's subsequently drawn into a "web of lies" as the show's 70 actors lead him toward participating in what the trailer suggests is a staged suicide.
The whole thing is a setup, of course, but <pname>Chris</pname> doesn't know that. The Push is the work of <pname>Derren Brown</pname>, a British mentalist whom Netflix describes as a "psychological illusionist." The reality special, an "audacious social experiment" is a consideration of how both authority figures and social pressures can manipulate an otherwise ordinary person in extraordinary ways.
The Push isn't actually a new release. It's one of two older Brown specials that originally aired in the United Kingdom and which Netflix has now picked up for re-release (the other is called The Miracle). <pname>Brown</pname> is also working on something completely new for the streaming giant, but no details have been released yet.
Even if The Push isn't technically new, the trailer released on Tuesday and the alarming premise it introduces prompted quite a reaction. 

Can't get behind #ThePush. As a movie sure, as a reality show it's a shitty idea. Let's severely damage people psychologically for ratings. Let's "push" someone into a truly dark place, a place that will haunt them and stay with them for the rest of their life. FUCK YOU @netflix!

Looks like someone at Netflix programming needs an ethics consultant, pretty desperately.... https://t.co/kuR6lL2I7u
