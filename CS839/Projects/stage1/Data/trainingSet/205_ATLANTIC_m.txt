The first scene that greets the viewer in The Killing of a Sacred Deer is gruesomely clinical—a top-down view of open-heart surgery, presented in matter-of-fact fashion, set to mournful music by <pname>Schubert</pname>. It’s an unpleasant image that’s both frightening and fragile, and impossible to look away from. How better to describe the work of the Greek writer and director <pname>Yorgos Lanthimos</pname>, whose particular storytelling style, exemplified by cult hits like 2009’s Dogtooth and 2015’s The Lobster, feels like a whole genre unto itself? <pname>Lanthimos</pname>’s new film is somehow even more macabre and unsettling than his previous efforts, and yet I also found myself laughing throughout. To be clear, The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a drama, and a grisly one at times. But it’s infused with <pname>Lanthimos</pname>’s unique way of looking at the world, which he populates with characters who speak in a robotic, detached manner. Though Sacred Deer makes more of an attempt to resemble real life (The Lobster was set in a heightened dystopia), it’s like a warped version of a scary story told to children around a campfire, a cautionary myth in which a seemingly perfect family comes up against an inexplicable force of darkness. With his latest movie, <pname>Lanthimos</pname> has made a tense, heart-wrenching tale with an admirably askance view of humanity that’s a worthy successor to his prior works. The Killing of a Sacred Deer follows a heart surgeon, <pname>Steven</pname> (<pname>Colin Farrell</pname>), who is happily married to <pname>Anna</pname> (<pname>Nicole Kidman</pname>), with whom he has two children, <pname>Kim</pname> (<pname>Raffey Cassidy</pname>) and <pname>Bob</pname> (<pname>Sunny Suljic</pname>). <pname>Steven</pname> has also taken an awkward teenager named <pname>Martin</pname> (<pname>Barry Keoghan</pname>) into his care, probably out of guilt after <pname>Barry</pname>’s father died under <pname>Steven</pname>’s knife during an operation; he’s educating the young man in the ways of the world, which in <pname>Steven</pname>’s eyes mostly involves owning expensive watches.
