Last week, we got a Trailer for filmmaker <pname>David Gordon Green</pname>’s next movie, the Boston Marathon related biopic Stronger. It seems like a big time showcase for <pname>Jake Gyllenhaal</pname> and could be tailor made to score him some Oscar attention. The film is coming a year after Patriots Day did justice to the tragedy, though this project seems to be more intimately positioned. With a September 22nd release date currently scheduled, fall festivals may not fully be in play, but awards possibilities just might. More on that in a bit, and of course the Trailer will be found below, but first…it’s analysis time!

The film is a presumably feel good story in the end, centering on <pname>Jeff Bauman</pname> (<pname>Jake Gyllenhaal</pname>), a victim of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013. There to support his partner <pname>Erin Hurley</pname> (<pname>Tatiana Maslany</pname>), who is running in the race, he’s seriously injuring in the blast at the finish line. Having lost his legs, <pname>Jeff</pname> has to struggle to attempt to recover from the devastating trauma while also doing what he can to help the authorities track down the terrorists who committed the bombing. Triumph over tragedy is inevitable, but the path looks to be potentially very emotional. <pname>Gordon Green</pname> directs a script by <pname>John Pollono</pname>. Also in the cast are <pname>Clancy Brown</pname> and <pname>Miranda Richardson</pname> as <pname>Jeff</pname>’s parents. <pname>Michael Brook</pname> contributes the score, while <pname>Sean Bobbitt</pname> handles the cinematography.
