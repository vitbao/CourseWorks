Happy Thanksgiving everybody! Hope you all are enjoying your turkey and political arguments with that uncle who disagrees with every ideology of yours. Anyway, once food is over, film should be at the forefront of your mind, especially considering how great the slate right now is. Opening on Friday is one of the year’s most praised bits of cinema in Call Me By Your Name. It has been gaining fans ever since the 2017 Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, running right up to earlier this week’s Film Independent Spirit Award nominations. Now, the viewing public can finally see what the fuss is all about. With few exceptions, it seems poised to live up to the hype.

The movie is a coming of age story as well as a romance. Set during 1983 in Northern Italy, we follow the Perlman family, expats from America. There’s seventeen year-old <pname>Elio</pname> (<pname>Timothée Chalamet</pname>), who is fascinated by the visiting <pname>Oliver</pname> (<pname>Armie Hammer</pname>), a research assistant for his professor father (<pname>Michael Stuhlbarg</pname>). <pname>Elio</pname> and <pname>Oliver</pname> are initially friends, sharing a Jewish heritage in a place where that’s uncommon, as well as an appreciation or laying around the Italian countryside. However, they both begin to bong over <pname>Elio</pname>’s emerging sexuality as well. From there, unexpected feelings emerge. Suffice to say though, both of their lives will be different from that point on. <pname>Luca Guadagnino</pname> directs the adaptation of André Aciman’s novel, which <pname>James Ivory</pname> penned the screenplay for. Gorgeous cinematography is provided by <pname>Sayombhu Mukdeeprom</pname>.
