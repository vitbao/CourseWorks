Last week, somewhat lost in the shuffle, a promising Trailer dropped for Chappaquiddick, a look at one of the defining moments in the life of the late politician <pname>Ted Kennedy</pname>. Initially scheduled for a late 2017 release, it opted to avoid the glut of titles and hold back for next year, which could prove a wise decision. This politically tinged historical drama could appeal to both sides of the aisle, admittedly for different reasons. New distributor on the block Entertainment Studios is trying to make a name for themselves, so a strong push for this one could be in the cards. From the Trailer at least, it looks like something to watch out for. If you’ve ever been curious about this particular <pname>Kennedy</pname> and his scandal, you’re in luck.

For those curious what this one specifically is about, it’s a drama about the Chappaquiddick incident, as it would come to be known. IMDb describes it as such: “<pname>Ted Kennedy</pname>’s life and political career become derailed after he is involved in a fatal 1969 car accident that claims the life of a young campaign strategist, <pname>Mary Jo Kopechne</pname>.” <pname>Kennedy</pname> (<pname>Clarke</pname>) and his team, led by <pname>Joe Gargan</pname> (<pname>Ed Helms</pname>) race to contain the situation, all in the shadow of <pname>Ted</pname>’s powerful father <pname>Joe</pname> (Bruce Dern). <pname>John Curran</pname> directs, while the team of <pname>Taylor Allen</pname> and <pname>Andrew Logan</pname> penned the screenplay. <pname>Garth Stevenson</pname> provides the score, while the cinematography is by the perpetually underrated <pname>Maryse Alberti</pname>.

During its film festival run late this year, reviews were pretty solid overall. From the looks of the Trailer, it should be an acting showcase. Clearly, <pname>Clarke</pname> is in fine form, really inhabiting the conflicted <pname>Kennedy</pname>. As for Dern, watch out for him again next year as an under the radar Best Supporting Actor player. He appears haunting as the patriarch, capturing your attention, and remember…he still doesn’t have an Academy Award. Whether or not Oscar comes calling, political junkies and history buffs will definitely be curious about this one. I know it has me eager to see it, that’s for sure.
