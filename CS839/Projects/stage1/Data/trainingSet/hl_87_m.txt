Another week, another remake hits multiplexes. It’s hard to argue against the fact that a new version of Murder on the Orient Express is supremely unnecessary. That’s just something we need to accept about Hollywood. Necessity there is not the mother of invention. At least in the case of this remake of the <pname>Agatha Christie</pname> whodunit, there’s an effort being made to make it look rather handsome. Under the stewardship of <pname>Kenneth Branagh</pname>, shot in glorious 70mm, this seems more like a creative lark for the team making the film than a quick cash grab. If nothing else, we have that to hold on to with this particular movie.

Based once again on <pname>Christie</pname>’s classic novel, the film follows renowned detective <pname>Hercule Poirot</pname> (<pname>Branagh</pname>) as he solves yet another seemingly unsolvable case. This time, he’s aboard a lavish train with thirteen other passengers, at least until one is found dead. With that, <pname>Poirot</pname> begins attempting to deduce which of the surviving dozen is behind the murder. As he works the case, the train is stuck in ice, potentially trapping them all with a killer. Soon, a crew will free the train and send it towards its destination. If <pname>Poirot</pname> hasn’t figured it out by then, the guilty party could get off. Fans of the book and previous films will know how this ends, obviously. <pname>Branagh</pname> directs an adaptation written by <pname>Michael Green</pname>. The score is from <pname>Patrick Doyle</pname>, while cinematography here is by <pname>Haris Zambarloukos</pname>.
