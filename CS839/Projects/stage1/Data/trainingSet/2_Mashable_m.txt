<pname>T'Challa</pname> finally got his very long overdue (get your sh*t together, Hollywood) standalone movie this February with Marvel's new movie Black Panther.
The good news is that the movie has already broken a ton of records, with a $427 million worldwide opening.
The bad news is that the movie is just over two hours, and, according to our movie critic, "If there's a downside to Black Panther, it's that it has to end eventually."

But just because the movie ends doesn't mean you have to stop exploring the world of Wakanda. That's where Black Panther: A Nation Under Our Feet comes in!
SEE ALSO: 'Black Panther' has the best Marvel supervillain ever. Yes, even better than Loki.
Black Panther: A Nation Under Our Feet is a 2016 Black Panther comic series written by award-winning author <pname>Ta-Nehisi Coates</pname>. Rather than facing off against <pname>Killmonger</pname> like in the movie, A Nation Under Our Feet introduces us to a <pname>T'Challa</pname> grappling with questions of how to govern and protect a Wakanda torn by war and dissent from within. The comic reveals a new side of <pname>T'Challa</pname> not yet seen in the movie, providing a new element of Black Panther to layer on top of <pname>Chadwick Boseman</pname>'s portrayal.
This week on the MashReads Podcast, we chat about Black Panther, both the new Marvel movie and the Ta-Nehisi Coates-written comic book reboot.
Join us in the episode above as we chat about what makes the Black Panther movie so special, how Killmonger ranks as a villain, and how the comic compares to the movie.

<pname>Brian De Los Santos</pname>, Mashable's assistant editor who joined us this week, recommends hyphy music, especially because of the Black Panther soundtrack. "It was the soundtrack to my high school experience, it was the one moment in which the Bay Area, growing up, had reached the map. Hyphy music has influences on the [Black Panther] soundtrack — E-40, Mac Dre, go ahead and listen to every song they've done. It's very related to this [Black Panther] discussion, and Oakland, and it's just very good music overall."
<pname>Martha</pname> recommends Queer Eye, Netflix's reboot of the early 2000s show Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. "It's one of those TV shows where you can go home, and sit on the couch and escape in it, and feel good."
<pname>Peter</pname> recommends The New York Times' podcast Still Processing. "We've talked about it on this podcast, but they've had back to back episodes that have really been wonderful to me. They did a fantastic one this week about Black Panther with <pname>Ta-Nehisi Coates</pname>. And the week before that they did a show on Three Billboards Outside Of Ebbing, Missouri and they were to succinctly describe my dissatisfaction with that film in a way that I was never able to put together in my head."
MJ recommends all of the hilarious writing about <pname>Fergie</pname>'s, um, colorful, national anthem performance, including "<pname>Fergie</pname> Apologizes for Giving America the National Anthem It Deserves" from The Root" and "A Brief, Fraught Timeline of My Attempt to Watch <pname>Fergie</pname>’s Whole Rendition of the National Anthem" from The Ringer. "The rendition was not the greatest. The writing about the rendition has been phenomenal."
