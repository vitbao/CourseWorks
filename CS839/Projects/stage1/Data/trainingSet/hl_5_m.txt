The month of February rarely sees Academy Award contenders released. Hell, it rarely sees good movies released. Furthermore, Marvel has never even come close to above the line Oscar contention. Throw in how much of a struggle it is for superhero movies in general to get prestige respect. And yet, right now, we’re already pondering what kind of awards love Marvel could see for Black Panther, one of the best installments of their Marvel Cinematic Universe. The MCU with a Best Picture nomination? It’s probably a long shot, but it’s not out of the question, and that’s something very unique and worth some discussion.
Before we begin, just keep in mind that it’s impossible to know how a Best Picture lineup will shake out almost a year in advance. As you’ll see when I drop year in advance predictions next month, it’s a total crapshoot. Go look at what I was predicting last year and you’ll see that in spades. So, no matter what, this is purely speculative. So much depends on what the competition is, how the year shapes up, and what stays on the minds of the industry. As such, while Black Panther is certainly worthy of this sort of pondering, nothing will be decided for almost a year. That’s just the way it is.
As a reminder, though considering the box office, it seems like everyone has seen this flick, Black Panther is the latest in the MCU. This is the IMDb plot description, to set the stage: “After the events of Captain America: Civil War, King <pname>T’Challa</pname> returns home to the reclusive, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to serve as his country’s new leader. However, <pname>T’Challa</pname> soon finds that he is challenged for the throne from factions within his own country. When two foes conspire to destroy Wakanda, the hero known as Black Panther must team up with C.I.A. agent <pname>Everett K. Ross</pname> and members of the Dora Milaje, Wakandan special forces, to prevent Wakanda from being dragged into a world war.” <pname>T’Challa</pname>/Black Panther (<pname>Chadwick Boseman</pname>) may be continuing part of the MCU, but right at this moment, his solo outing is about to become a smash hit all on its own. The score is by <pname>Ludwig Göransson</pname>, while the cinematography is by freshly minted Oscar nominee <pname>Rachel Morrison</pname>.
