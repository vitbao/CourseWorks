Over the next month, The Atlantic’s “And, Scene” series will delve into some of the most interesting films of the year by examining a single, noteworthy moment and unpacking what it says about 2017. Next up is <pname>James Gray</pname>’s The Lost City of Z. (Read our previous entries here.) The Lost City of Z is a film about the siren song of the unknown—the chance that just around every bend of the Amazon River could be evidence of a forgotten civilization, or even better, its ancient capital, a place of art and industry that flourished long before European colonists had ever dreamed of invading South America and draining its resources. That song is why <pname>Percy Fawcett</pname> (<pname>Charlie Hunnam</pname>) keeps coming back to the Amazon rainforest in <pname>James Gray</pname>’s swooning, sweltering epic. The explorer wants hard evidence of a hunch he’s had ever since his first trip to the Bolivian jungle: that there was a world there uncharted by his superiors in the British Army.
