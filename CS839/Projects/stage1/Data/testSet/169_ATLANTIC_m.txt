“I was loved for a minute, then I was hated, then I was just a punchline,” <pname>Tonya Harding</pname> (<pname>Margot Robbie</pname>) tells the camera in I, <pname>Tonya</pname>, summing up the life cycle of a scandalous public figure with pithy efficiency. She was once a competitive ice skater with serious promise, becoming the first American woman to land the notoriously hard triple axel jump in competition. She was a misfit in a cloistered world, performing routines to songs like ZZ Top’s “Sleeping Bag” and the Jurassic Park theme rather than placid classical music. And, of course, she was at the center of the sport’s most shocking incident of all time: the 1994 attack on her teammate <pname>Nancy Kerrigan</pname> orchestrated in part by <pname>Harding</pname>’s ex-husband <pname>Jeff Gillooly</pname>. <pname>Craig Gillespie</pname>’s (The Finest Hours, <pname>Lars</pname> and the Real Girl) biopic makes the assault on <pname>Kerrigan</pname> its centerpiece, but it also examines <pname>Harding</pname> as a larger symbol of how classist, sexist, and image-obsessed celebrity culture can be. As played by <pname>Robbie</pname>, <pname>Harding</pname> is brash and foul-mouthed, but she’s also a victim of her own fame and of a judgmental audience. <pname>Robbie</pname>’s performance is undoubtedly sympathetic to <pname>Harding</pname> as she experiences widespread shaming in the aftermath of the <pname>Kerrigan</pname> attack. But I, <pname>Tonya</pname> too often feels glib and glancing, holding the public responsible for many of the easy assumptions and narrative shortcuts the film itself indulges in while telling <pname>Harding</pname>’s story. The movie (written by <pname>Steven Rogers</pname>) is “based on irony-free, wildly contradictory, totally true interviews with <pname>Tonya Harding</pname> and <pname>Jeff Gillooly</pname>,” it announces in its opening title card. <pname>Harding</pname> and <pname>Gillooly</pname> (<pname>Sebastian Stan</pname>) narrate straight to camera, reminiscing on their violent marriage and <pname>Harding</pname>’s rise and fall in the early 1990s, as if they’re in a particularly grim episode of The Office.
