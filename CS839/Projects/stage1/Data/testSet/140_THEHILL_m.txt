Senators are struggling to break through a legislative stalemate on immigration, with centrists making a frantic push to find a deal that can win enough support to pass by the end of the week. The centrist senators on Wednesday said that they had finished the contours of an agreement that would protect “Dreamers” in exchange for more spending on border security. But in a sign of just how harried the push has become, the official language of the agreement wasn't revealed until late Wednesday night after hours of what Sen. <pname>Jeff Flake</pname>    (R-Ariz) called "tidying up the language." The clock is ticking. Senate Majority Leader <pname>Mitch McConnell</pname>    (R-Ky.) has made clear that he intends to move on from the immigration debate after this week, leaving little time for any faction to cobble together 60 votes for an immigration bill. The centrists appear to have the highest odds of success. If every Democrat supported the group’s proposal — which is not guaranteed — the centrists would need the votes of 11 GOP senators for a bill to pass. Roughly a dozen Republicans have been taking part in the Common Sense Coalition talks. “Our group from the very beginning has been committed to coming up with a bipartisan plan on immigration and that’s what it appears we’ve been able to do,” Sen. <pname>Susan Collins</pname>    (R-Maine), who has been leading the talks, told reporters as she headed to a meeting in <pname>McConnell</pname>’s office. The centrist plan, unveiled Wednesday by a group of 16 bipartisan senators, would protect 1.8 million Dreamers from deportation and provide $25 billion for border security. While it would prevent Dreamers from sponsoring a parent who knowingly brought them into the country illegally, it does not include the broader changes to legal immigration or interior enforcement favored by President <pname>Trump</pname>    and House Republicans. <pname>Collins</pname> wouldn’t say whether the proposal has 60 votes, nor would <pname>Flake</pname>.
