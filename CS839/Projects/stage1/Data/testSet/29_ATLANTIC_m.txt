The women of the 2018 Golden Globes collectively (almost) wore black. On the red carpet, many of them brought as their dates not husbands and partners, but activists for gender and racial equality. They talked about endemic sexual harassment in America and a sea change sparked by industry-shattering stories from The New York Times and The New Yorker about the abuse perpetrated for decades by <pname>Harvey Weinstein</pname>. The men of the Golden Globes wore (some of them) Time’s Up pins. On the red carpet, they were asked less about <pname>Weinstein</pname> and #MeToo than about their work. They shifted uncomfortably when the actress <pname>Natalie Portman</pname> emphasized the “all-male” directing nominees in film. Accepting their awards, they thanked their mothers, their wives (in one case their wives and their girlfriends), their agents, the nation of Italy for its great food. The composer <pname>Alexandre Desplat</pname> observed that this award was a different color to the previous one he’d claimed. But, facing a sea of women wearing black, not one of the dozen-plus men who received an award seemed compelled to note that anything about the night was different. For the men of the Golden Globes—with the exception of the host, <pname>Seth Meyers</pname>, who delivered a series of jokes skewering <pname>Weinstein</pname>—it was business as usual. It was a notable disparity on an evening in which women had, for the first time in awards-show history, coordinated their color schemes to draw attention to inequality in the entertainment industry and beyond. But the women of the Golden Globes didn’t just wear black—they also used, for the most part, their minutes on the public stage to talk thoughtfully and inclusively about sexual harassment and assault in America and around the world. Accepting the evening’s first trophy for her role playing a domestic-assault survivor in the HBO miniseries Big Little Lies, <pname>Nicole Kidman</pname> praised “the power of women” and talked about the scourge of abuse. “I do believe, and I hope, we can elicit change through the stories we tell and the way we tell them,” she said. It was a moment that set a tone for the evening: Subsequent winners from <pname>Laura Dern</pname> to <pname>Rachel Brosnahan</pname> to <pname>Elisabeth Moss</pname> to <pname>Oprah</pname> used their platforms to speak about the need for women’s voices to be heard. Many mentioned the Time’s Up campaign specifically, in a coordinated effort. But the subtext men seemed to hear was that women’s voices are the only ones that matter when it comes to advocating for change. <pname>Alexander Skarsgård</pname>, who played the abuser of Kidman’s character in Big Little Lies, praised the “extraordinarily talented” group of women he had the privilege of working with on the show. He wore a Time’s Up pin on his lapel. But he said nothing about the themes of the evening, or even the themes of the show he’d just won an award for. <pname>Martin McDonagh</pname>, whose film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is about a grieving mother seeking public justice for the rape and murder of her daughter, also said nothing about how uncannily the topic of his award-winning work intersected with the state of Hollywood in its post-<pname>Weinstein</pname> moment. <pname>Bruce Miller</pname>, the executive producer of the Golden Globe–winning drama The Handmaid’s Tale, was the only male award-winner of the night who even alluded to #MeToo, stating, “To all the people in this room and this country and this world who do everything they can to stop The Handmaid’s Tale from becoming real, keep doing that.”
