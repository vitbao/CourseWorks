Welcome to November, if you can believe it, ladies and gentlemen! We’re well into the fourth quarter of the year now, which is still crazy to think about. It also signals the point where it becomes an veritable embarrassment of riches at the cinema. Yes, not only do I have ten really interesting new releases to show you for this month, as is usually the case around this time of year, almost all of my Honorable Mentions would be worthy of inclusion in almost any other month. In fact, two or three really killed me to leave out. You’ll understand momentarily, but just know that this is easily the most stacked month so far. You can’t go wrong even if you tried. It’s just that good a calendar slate…

Here now are the very best cinematic bets for November:

3. Darkest Hour – <pname>Gary Oldman</pname>seems to have Best Actor on lockdown for his turn as <pname>Winston Churchill</pname>. Moreover, <pname>Joe Wright</pname>’s biopic of the former Prime Minister seems like one of the big players in Best Picture as well. More will be on the way once I see it next week, so hang tight for more there in the very near future…
2. Lady Bird – Just this week, I raved about <pname>Greta Gerwig</pname>’s film. It’s truly a wonderful movie, one that I adored back at NYFF and still absolutely love right now. It’s a true delight, with a turn by <pname>Laurie Metcalf</pname> that could be catnip in Best Supporting Actress. Don’t you dare miss this one when it opens on Friday!
1. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri – The second best film I’ve seen so far this year, this is perfect cinema. Seriously, it’s brilliant. <pname>Frances McDormand</pname> has never been better, while <pname>Sam Rockwell</pname> may finally get nominated for his overdue first Academy Award. I’ll be raving about it very soon, so sit tight for that love letter before the month is out…
Honorable Mentions: 11/8/16, A Bad Moms Christmas, Daddy’s Home 2, Gilbert, LBJ, Mudbound, Murder on the Orient Express, The Star, Thelma, and Wonder

Be sure to check out these various films all throughout the month of November!
