“Sit down,” <pname>Larry Bloom</pname> (<pname>Kevin Costner</pname>) says to his daughter <pname>Molly</pname> (<pname>Jessica Chastain</pname>) near the end of <pname>Aaron Sorkin</pname>’s directorial debut, <pname>Molly</pname>’s Game. “I’m going to give you three years of therapy in three minutes.” It’s a line seemingly meant to draw scoffs and eye-rolls, a cherry on top of the ostentatious 140-minute sundae that is this movie—a dramatic retelling of the rise and fall of a real-life underground-poker mogul. <pname>Sorkin</pname> has been one of Hollywood’s premier screenwriters for decades, creating the TV hit The West Wing and scripting films like The Social Network, Moneyball, and <pname>Steve Jobs</pname>. For years, <pname>Sorkin</pname>’s rat-a-tat conversation has been interpreted by famed directors like <pname>David Fincher</pname> and <pname>Mike Nichols</pname>. Now, we’re finally getting the unfiltered version. Buckle up. If you’re fond of <pname>Sorkin</pname>’s script flourishes (in which his characters lob whole thesauruses of dialogue at each other with practiced ease), his nesting-doll plot structure (which reveals further story depths by cutting backward and forward in various timelines), and his love of long, mission-statement monologues, then <pname>Molly</pname>’s Game is for you. The biopic digs into the differences between public and private perceptions, topics that have long fascinated <pname>Sorkin</pname>. It’s also anchored by a steely, assured performance from <pname>Chastain</pname>, an actress who was born to deliver <pname>Sorkin</pname>’s soliloquies. Ultimately, I had a great time watching the film, even if it outstayed its welcome by about 20 minutes. There are very few Hollywood screenwriters these days who can stir up auteurist fascination by themselves. For all of <pname>Sorkin</pname>’s scripting foibles, there’s a delight to seeing them shine through each of his projects, no matter who’s behind the camera. In adapting the memoir of <pname>Molly Bloom</pname>, who ran elite poker games for millionaires and celebrities in Los Angeles and New York before getting busted by the FBI, <pname>Sorkin</pname> has given viewers another tale of unusual fame (having written about presidents, baseball managers, and tech CEOs in the past). But in directing the film himself, he’s shed new light on his deepest interests. In the hands of <pname>Fincher</pname>, who made The Social Network, a <pname>Sorkin</pname> script was haunting, even maniacal, turning the rise of the Facebook inventor <pname>Mark Zuckerberg</pname> into a tale of a driven, sociopathic conqueror. <pname>Danny Boyle</pname>, who directed <pname>Steve Jobs</pname>, framed that story as a glimpse into the life of a remote godlike being, simultaneously a hellish nuisance and a divine inspiration to the people around him. <pname>Rob Reiner</pname> made The American President into a swooning, autumnal hymn to political idealism, a quality thought dead in the mid-1990s.
