So far, filmmaker <pname>Scott Cooper</pname> has yet to really crack through with a true vision. He’s directed <pname>Jeff Bridges</pname> to an Oscar with Crazy Heart, as well as had would be awards players in Black Mass and Out of the Furnace. Still, his work felt very anonymous, like for hire jobs that anyone could have done. That’s not a knock on his skills, but simply that he’d never left his own mark on a movie yet. That has changed now with his latest outing, the bleak western Hostiles. It feels like everything <pname>Cooper</pname> has done so far has led him to this flick.

This movie is a western set in 1892. After a horrific opening detailing the slaughter of everyone <pname>Rosalie Quaid</pname> (<pname>Rosamund Pike</pname>) loves, we meet legendary Army captain <pname>Joseph J. Blocker</pname> (<pname>Christian Bale</pname>). About to set out on his last mission before retirement, it’s one he’s only reluctantly agreed to. The task is to escort a Cheyenne chief named <pname>Yellow Hawk</pname> (<pname>Wes Studi</pname>) and his family through dangerous territory in order to allow the chief to die with dignity at his home. <pname>Blocker</pname> organizes a group of men to go with him, and they set out. Soon, however, they stumble upon <pname>Rosalie</pname>, still in shock from her tragedy. They take her in, though this puts them even further on the radar of a brutal Comanche tribe. Suffice to say, much blood will be spilt on this excursion. <pname>Cooper</pname> writes and directs

I’m not joking when I say this film is brutal. The opening sequence details at least one death that is literally shocking. <pname>Cooper</pname> goes there. Beyond that, the movie is very deliberate, pace wise, almost to a fault, though it earns the big beats. <pname>Bale</pname> and <pname>Pike</pname> are reliably great, while <pname>Studi</pname> is excellent in his supporting turn. The highlight for me is actually the cinematography of <pname>Takayanagi</pname>, who deserves awards consideration. If the film has a weak point, it’s the ending, but that merely keeps a very good flick from being a great one. Under the radar, this is one of 2017’s better surprises.
Oscar wise, Hostiles may be debuting too late in the game to leave a mark, but the quality is there. Academy Award consideration is warranted in Best Picture, Best Director (for <pname>Cooper</pname>), Best Actor (for <pname>Bale</pname>), Best Supporting Actor (for <pname>Studi</pname>), Best Supporting Actress (for <pname>Pike</pname>), Best Adapted Screenplay (for <pname>Cooper</pname> as well), Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score. Most of these are long shots, though watch out for Cinematography to happen. It’s certainly good enough. There’s also an outside possibility for <pname>Bale</pname> to shock in Actor or for <pname>Cooper</pname> to take advantage of a rough Adapted Screenplay category. Stay tuned to find out…
