<pname>Arsène Wenger</pname> has confirmed that <pname>David Ospina</pname> will start for Arsenal against Östersund in the Europa League on Thursday night and against Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday.<pname>Wenger</pname> admitted it was tough to overlook his first-choice goalkeeper, <pname>Petr Cech</pname>, for the Wembley final but the manager has refused to deviate from his policy of starting <pname>Ospina</pname> in the cup competitions.<pname>Ospina</pname>, whose contract is due to expire next summer, has played in all of Arsenal’s cup games this season except the home and away Europa League ties against Red Star Belgrade and the Carabao Cup home win against Norwich City, which he missed with groin trouble.<pname>Wenger</pname> turned to <pname>Cech</pname> in Belgrade and <pname>Matt Macey</pname> in the other two games. He started <pname>Ospina</pname> over <pname>Cech</pname> in Arsenal’s FA Cup final victory against Chelsea last season.“They are always difficult decisions but we have been clear since the start of the season that he [<pname>Ospina</pname>] plays in the whole competition,” <pname>Wenger</pname> said, with regard to his Carabao Cup final selection. “I have two world-class goalkeepers and I decided to have clarity in the games they play and we maintain that.”Arsenal are 3-0 up against Östersund, having won the first leg of the Europa League last-32 tie in Sweden, and <pname>Wenger</pname> will rest players for the return. <pname>Mesut Özil</pname> will not play because of an illness he picked up over the weekend; he returned to training on Wednesday, although <pname>Wenger</pname> said the midfielder would be fit to face City.<pname>Aaron Ramsey</pname> remains out with a groin injury, although he trained on Wednesday and <pname>Wenger</pname> has refused to rule him out for Sunday. “Ideally, you want to have the choice but our job is about adaptation,” <pname>Wenger</pname> said, with regard to <pname>Ramsey</pname>’s cup final prospects. “Rarely in life do you have ideal situations, with the luxury to choose from all the players.”<pname>Henrikh Mkhitaryan</pname>, who is cup-tied in the Carabao Cup, will start against Östersund, as will <pname>Danny Welbeck</pname>. <pname>Wenger</pname> also gave an update on <pname>Alexandre Lacazette</pname>, who is out after knee surgery last week. “I think he will be ahead of the planned recovery,” <pname>Wenger</pname> said. “It should be four weeks, maybe three and a half.”
