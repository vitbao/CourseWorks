Liar, a six-part miniseries whose finale airs on SundanceTV on Wednesday, is constructed around the premise that two people are telling different stories about a sexual encounter and one of them is lying. <pname>Laura</pname> (Downton Abbey’s <pname>Joanne Froggatt</pname>) has no memory of what happened at the end of her date with <pname>Andrew</pname> (<pname>Ioan Gruffudd</pname>) and thinks she’s been raped. <pname>Andrew</pname> insists the sex was consensual, and that <pname>Laura</pname>’s furious public statements are ruining his reputation. Complicating matters further is that <pname>Andrew</pname>, a surgeon and single father, is a pillar of the community, while <pname>Laura</pname> is increasingly unstable, and—it emerges—has a history of making allegations against men that she later retracted. I’ve watched Liar with increasing queasiness over the past few weeks, amid the rising tide of charges against <pname>Harvey Weinstein</pname> and similarly powerful men. On the one hand, the British-made show, which is written by the brothers <pname>Harry</pname> and <pname>Jack Williams</pname>, is sensitive in its portrayal of assault—it provides no explicit footage or images of the act itself. On the other, that’s because the show’s central mystery is what exactly happened in <pname>Laura</pname>’s flat that night.
