“All of us are excited by what we most deplore,” <pname>Martin Amis</pname> wrote in the London Review of Books in 1980, reviewing <pname>Joan Didion</pname>’s The White Album. In the title piece in that collection, <pname>Didion</pname>’s second, the essayist recalls sitting in her sister-in-law’s swimming pool in Beverly Hills on August 9, 1969, when the phone rang. The friend on the line had heard that across town there had been a spate of murders at a house rented by the director <pname>Roman Polanski</pname>, on Cielo Drive. Early reports were frenzied, shocking, lurid, and incorrect. “I remember all of the day’s misinformation very clearly,” <pname>Didion</pname> writes, “and I also remember this, and wish I did not: I remember that no one was surprised.” The killings orchestrated that summer by <pname>Charles Manson</pname>, who died on Sunday at the age of 83, after spending the past 48 years in prison, occupy a unique space in the American cultural psyche. All of the elements of the <pname>Tate</pname>–<pname>LaBianca</pname> murders, as they came to be known, seemed designed for maximum tabloid impact. There was the actor <pname>Sharon Tate</pname>, luminously beautiful and eight months pregnant, who was stabbed to death with four others at a rental home in Hollywood. There were the killers—young women, <pname>Manson</pname> acolytes corrupted by a sinister cult figure. There were the drugs, abundant both on the <pname>Manson</pname> Family ranch and at the house on Cielo Drive. There was the nebulous chatter about satanism and witchcraft and race wars ready to erupt. And, as <pname>Didion</pname> captured, there was a sense that something was rotten from the Hollywood Hills to Haight-Ashbury—that the Summer of Love had long since curdled into paranoia and depravity.
