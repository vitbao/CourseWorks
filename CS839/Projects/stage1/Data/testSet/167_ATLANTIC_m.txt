Given that Oscar season is upon us, it’s hardly surprising that Darkest Hour is being pushed, first and foremost, as an awards showcase for <pname>Gary Oldman</pname>, who excels in the thunderous role of <pname>Winston Churchill</pname>. But the film works so well because of the care its director <pname>Joe Wright</pname> (Pride & Prejudice, Atonement, <pname>Anna Karenina</pname>) takes in balancing the British prime minister’s big, theatrical public presence with his more tormented inner life.Darkest Hour follows <pname>Churchill</pname> in May 1940, his first month in office, as he seeks to balance the desires of his political party, which wants to avoid mass bloodshed on the scale of World War I, against his own resolute belief in resisting Nazi Germany at all costs. <pname>Churchill</pname> was seen by the party (and by Britain’s King <pname>George VI</pname>) as a warmonger responsible for the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign in the last war. But he doubted himself, too: <pname>Wright</pname> depicts the leader wondering if his demands of “victory at all costs” from his country were too much. The Atlantic talked to <pname>Wright</pname> about crafting a fresh portrayal of <pname>Churchill</pname>’s character, the typical pitfalls that come with making a biopic of a well-known public figure, and whether audiences might see any present-day parallels in Darkest Hour. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. <pname>David Sims</pname>: Recently, there’s been such a glut of <pname>Winston Churchills</pname> on screen. Were you worried about that at all going into Darkest Hour?
