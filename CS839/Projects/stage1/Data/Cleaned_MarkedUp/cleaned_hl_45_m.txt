  I know, I know, this month is not one to get excited about at all, new release wise. January is usually a real dumping ground for films. That's normally true, but if you look hard enough, you can find worthwhile titles hitting screens. This year is no exception, as 2018 has a handful of pretty decent movies hitting in its first month. I can personally vouch for a couple that I've seen already, so there's that. Your mileage may vary with these, but if you look hard enough, you're sure to find a few things to enjoy. For sure, the expanding 2017 titles are superior, but it's not all about those. Without any further delay though, here are the first batch of 2018 titles that don't appear to be wastes of time. At least one is legitimately very good too… Here now are ten January releases in particular to look forward to:  4. Please Stand By – This independent film is the latest directorial outing by The Sessions filmmaker <pname>Ben Lewin</pname>, starring <pname>Dakota Fanning</pname> in a slightly baity role as an autistic woman on the run. Assuming it doesn't fall through the cracks, it could even be a crossover hit. <pname>Fanning</pname> is due this sort of showcase, so count me in.  3. Mom and Dad – The most fun film of the year so far, this is an insane action/comedy/horror hybrid with <pname>Nicolas Cage</pname> chewing some scenery as only he can. I've already seen it and really dug the movie. It's nuts, but in a really smile inducing way. Filmmaker <pname>Brian Taylor</pname> commits to a crazy premise and just has the time of his life. It will rub off on the audience too, trust me there.  2. Blame – A standout at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival, this drama is all the more impressive when you look at who made it. Writer/director/star <pname>Quinn Shepherd</pname> began working on this movie when she was 15, completed it at 20, and now sees it come out at the ripe old age of 22. A take off on The Crucible, it's a great little flick that deserves to find an audience. Don't sleep on this one…  1. The Final Year – One of the best documentaries I saw last year, it finally hits theaters this month. A look at the final year (get it?) of the Obama Administration, especially the foreign policy team, it's a super compelling and inside baseball look at politics.  Be sure to check these films out as the month of January rolls on!
