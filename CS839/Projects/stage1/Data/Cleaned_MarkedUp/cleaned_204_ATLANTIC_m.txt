 The only genuine emotion that Suburbicon managed to conjure from me was dread. This creeping feeling arrived not long into <pname>George Clooney</pname>'s new film, which is based on an old screenplay by the <pname>Coen</pname> brothers (written in the 1980s, and extensively rewritten by <pname>Clooney</pname> and his reliable co-scripter <pname>Grant Heslov</pname>). The film cross-cuts between two disconnected storylines within a cloistered suburban community—one following a madcap life-insurance scam being run by the seemingly upstanding <pname>Gardner Lodge</pname> (<pname>Matt Damon</pname>), and another following the <pname>Mayers</pname>, an African American family who recently moved into the neighborhood and are being ostracized by the white residents. About 30 minutes into the movie, a depressing thought dawned on me: These storylines are never going to intersect. And indeed, they don't. Rather than make either a goofily violent <pname>Coen</pname>-brothers homage or a sober retelling of a real-life incident of American intolerance, <pname>Clooney</pname> decided to do both at the same time—a decision that marginalizes the two stories in bizarre ways. The result is a film that is both mundanely and inimitably bad. Had Suburbicon committed to its primary crime-caper plot, it might have been just another forgettable, uninspired film.
