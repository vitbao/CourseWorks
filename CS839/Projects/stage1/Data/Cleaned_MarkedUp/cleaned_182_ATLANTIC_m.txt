 “You have me riveted,” reads the incoming text. “How long will you be in NY?” Later that evening, my phone lights up again: “Reading with pleasure.” The next ping:  “Exquisite pleasure in fact.” The man writing me these texts was <pname>James Toback</pname>. He'd struck up a conversation earlier that day at The Harvard Club in New York, where he'd spotted me sitting alone with a cup of tea, typing away at my laptop. Might he share my table? Might he ask my name? What brought me to town? Book tour, I told him. I'd just published a novel. Well, fancy that. He was a movie director. Had I ever seen Black and White? He and <pname>Jessica Chastain</pname> were tight, he informed me; she would be perfect to play my protagonist. Riiiiiight, I thought. But I Googled him when he excused himself to the men's room, and the first photo that popped up was of him with <pname>Alec Baldwin</pname>, arms linked, strolling the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival. When <pname>Toback</pname> returned, he scribbled down the address of his apartment on Park Avenue. Perhaps I would care to swing by later, to deliver a copy of my book. Umm, no, thank you. I arranged a bike courier to drop it instead. Over the following weeks, <pname>Toback</pname> texted and called. I never saw him again. Does it go without saying that he never produced the movie version of my book? My encounter with <pname>Toback</pname> came in 2013, and I hadn't thought of him for ages, until the Los Angeles Times broke a story last month. The headline took my breath away:  38 Women Have Come Forward to Accuse Director <pname>James Toback</pname> of Sexual Harassment.
