 The premise of <pname>Ridley Scott</pname>'s All the Money in the World can be summed up in one famous word, uttered by the oil tycoon <pname>J. Paul Getty</pname> (<pname>Christopher Plummer</pname>) to the press regarding the kidnapping of his grandson <pname>Paul</pname> (<pname>Charlie Plummer</pname>) in 1973. How much would <pname>Getty</pname>, at that point the richest man alive, pay to have the teenage boy returned safely? “Nothing,” he says, almost chortling at the thought. It was a real-life moment that seems worthy of Greek tragedy, and it's at the core of <pname>Scott</pname>'s dramatic re-creation of the kidnapping. After all, what could possibly motivate a man of such means to think something so callous? That's the question underlying this quasi-biopic, quasi-thriller, which touches on how <pname>Getty</pname> got his riches and his miserly nature, as well as on the broad beats of the kidnapping story. This is a fable about the poisonous quality of wealth, one that attempts to burrow into the mind of a man who'd publicly announce his disinterest in rescuing his own grandson. But the film spends too much time in the gummy details of <pname>Paul</pname>'s kidnapping, a disturbingly farcical series of events that saw him passed around by Italian gangsters like a faded trophy, when all of its best material involves the elder <pname>Getty</pname>'s recalcitrance. All the Money in the World is destined to be remembered best for the unique story of its production, in which <pname>Kevin Spacey</pname> (who originally played <pname>Getty</pname>) was replaced with <pname>Plummer</pname> less than two months before the film's release after a slew of sexual-assault allegations against <pname>Spacey</pname>. That <pname>Scott</pname> somehow managed to reshoot every scene involving <pname>Getty</pname> is nothing short of miraculous given the methodical nature of movie production. <pname>Plummer</pname>'s role isn't small—he's all over this film. Still, it's telling that the behind-the-scenes drama looms larger than the movie itself. All the Money in the World is watchable and at times quite gripping, but it's little more than a middling entry in <pname>Scott</pname>'s long career. The film begins with <pname>Paul</pname>'s kidnapping. A flaxen-haired 16-year-old living in Rome, <pname>Paul</pname> was the son of <pname>John Paul Getty Jr</pname>. (<pname>Andrew Buchan</pname>), an erstwhile heir to the <pname>Getty</pname> Oil empire who struggled with substance abuse and had divorced <pname>Paul</pname>'s mother <pname>Gail</pname> (<pname>Michelle Williams</pname>). So when <pname>Gail</pname> gets the ransom call, demanding $17 million for her son's safe return, she has to petition her former father-in-law for help, not having a fortune of her own to tap. The only problem being that <pname>J. Paul Getty</pname> was not known for his generosity.
