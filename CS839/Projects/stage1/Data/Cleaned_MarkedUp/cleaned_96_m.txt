   If you've been feasting on “The Crown,” <pname>Moira Buffini</pname>'s delectable “Handbagged” will skip you ahead to the <pname>Thatcher</pname> years. The fast-paced British play freely imagines meetings between the prim queen and the steely Iron Lady, and they don't agree on much — not even, in this comically self-aware show, whether there should be an intermission. <pname>Buffini</pname>'s London hit is getting a spiffy U.S. debut at the Round House Theatre courtesy of <pname>Indhu Rubasingham</pname>, the show's original director and head of London's influential Tricycle Theatre (originator of “The Great Game: Afghanistan” and an entire genre known as “tribunal plays”). <pname>Richard Kent</pname>'s gleaming white set is a Union Jack-shaped lattice, an uncluttered yet epic backdrop for <pname>Buffini</pname>'s dashing tug of war. What <pname>Buffini</pname> gives us isn't merely one queen and prime minister, but two. <pname>Beth Hylton</pname> is “<pname>Liz</pname>” and <pname>Susan Lynskey</pname> is “<pname>Mags</pname>,” the rulers at the ages they were during the tumultuous 1980s. Older versions squabbling to set the record straight are played by <pname>Kate Fahy</pname>, reprising her U.K. turn as <pname>Thatcher</pname>, and <pname>Jennifer Mendenhall</pname> as the queen. The title refers to being smacked with a purse, a misogynist way of describing <pname>Thatcher</pname>'s knockdown style. That's <pname>Buffini</pname>'s real subject, and of course <pname>Thatcher</pname>'s strongman theory of law-and-order patriotism, individual responsibility and a scantly regulated business sector has its echoes now (mostly resonant, occasionally tinny). <pname>Lynskey</pname> and <pname>Fahy</pname> are practically feral as <pname>Thatcher</pname> latches onto the Falklands conflict, drooling for war. She's a full-throated bully. If that appalls <pname>Liz</pname>, <pname>Hylton</pname> and <pname>Mendenhall</pname> give shrewdly understated portraits of the queen's moral disapproval. They're also spot-on with comic relief, especially when we are reminded how much this queen loves her horses and dogs. <pname>Thatcher</pname> can be funny, too: recalling the ordeal of a mucky picnic with the outdoorsy queen up at Balmoral, she scoffs, “It was more stressful than a NATO summit.”    <pname>Beth Hylton</pname>, <pname>Kate Fahy</pname>, <pname>Jennifer Mendenhall</pname> and <pname>Susan Lynskey</pname> in “Handbagged.”     <pname>Buffini</pname>'s breezy script is laced with crosstalk, and it's booby-trapped with rebellion. <pname>Cody LeRoy Wilson</pname> and <pname>John Lescault</pname> play all the necessary men from <pname>Thatcher</pname>'s husband, <pname>Denis</pname>, to <pname>Ronald Reagan</pname> and <pname>Neil Kinnock</pname>. This means there's even more arguing over what really mattered in the 1980s — the miners' strikes? The anti-nuke protests by the women of Greenham Common? Violence from <pname>Gerry Adams</pname> and the Irish resistance <pname>Sinn Fein</pname>? The rallies are lively, and while <pname>Hylton</pname> (still aglow with privilege from her role as <pname>Marie Antoinette</pname> in the recent “The Revolutionists”) and the prowling <pname>Lynskey</pname> are fine as the younger <pname>Liz</pname> and <pname>Mags</pname>, <pname>Fahy</pname> and <pname>Mendenhall</pname> are particularly crisp. <pname>Fahy</pname> has the <pname>Thatcher</pname> voice and bearing — supreme, intellectually intimidating — while <pname>Mendenhall</pname> has the ginger, subtly rigid style we also see in <pname>Claire Foy</pname>'s portrait in “The Crown.” <pname>Buffini</pname> gives this Elizabeth most of the good lines, and <pname>Mendenhall</pname> nails them with wily timing. <pname>Buffini</pname> doesn't seem to like <pname>Thatcher</pname>, but she gets how her muscular magnetism attracted followers hungry for a newly great Britain. The script, showcased as part of Washington's ongoing Women's Voices Theater Festival, has a prismatic quality; the light of history glints differently depending on who's telling it. <pname>Buffini</pname> has fun shifting the attention around, and Rubasingham's production is so sure-footed that the whole show shines.
