 Sen. <pname>Kamala Harris</pname>    (D-Calif.) on Thursday called for gun control following the deadly mass shooting at a Florida high school. <pname>Harris</pname> said during an interview on MSNBC that she had to look at autopsy photographs when she served as a prosecutor. "When you see the effect of this extreme violence on a human body and especially the body of a child, maybe it will shock some people into understanding," she said. "This cannot be a political issue. We have to be practical." <pname>Harris</pname> said she supports the Second Amendment, but "we have to have smart gun safety laws." "And we cannot tolerate a society and live in a country with any level of pride when our babies are being slaughtered," she said. At least 17 people were killed and more were wounded when a gunman opened fire on Wednesday at a high school near Fort Lauderdale. Multiple lawmakers have called for Congress to act following the deadly shooting. President <pname>Trump</pname>    on Thursday said he is making plans to visit the school. He added that he would "tackle the difficult issue of mental health," but did not weigh in directly on the contentious debate over gun control. He also vowed his administration would seek to address safety issues in schools.
