  Watching the changing winds in terms of Downsizing has been fascinating this awards season. Initially, out of the Venice Film Festival, it was looked at as a big time Oscar player. Then, moving on to the Telluride Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival, its star faded. This week, <pname>Alexander Payne</pname>'s latest opens and hopes to right the ship with the general public. Critics have not been kind overall, but audiences will have the final say. Either way, what was once a conceivable Academy Award frontrunner will now struggle not to be shut out. My how times can change in a hurry.  The film is a rather high concept dramedy with a science fiction baseline to launch things. The official synopsis presents things as such: “When scientists discover how to shrink humans to five inches tall as a solution to over-population, <pname>Paul</pname> (<pname>Matt Damon</pname>) and his wife <pname>Audrey</pname> (<pname>Kristen Wiig</pname>) decide to abandon their stressed lives in order to get small and move to a new downsized community — a choice that triggers life-changing adventures.” That's an accurate description, though only for the first act. After that, once <pname>Paul</pname> is shrunken, he spends a lot of time doing nothing with irritating characters like <pname>Dusan Mirkovic</pname> (<pname>Christoph Waltz</pname>). However, before things end, he'll have gone on an adventure with divisive character <pname>Gong Jiang</pname> (<pname>Hong Chau</pname>), who change his outlook on life. The longer it goes on, the less interesting it gets, frankly. <pname>Payne</pname> co-writes with longtime partner <pname>Jim Taylor</pname> and directs here. <pname>Phedon Papamichael</pname> handles the cinematography, while <pname>Rolfe Ken</pname>t provides the score.
