  Given how few people live in the tiny mining outpost of “Goldstone,” the abundance of wickedness is astonishing. Yet this parched Outback western, awash in noirish mannerisms and a sunstroke-inducing palette, harbors a robust social conscience beneath its hotbed of bribery and sex trafficking. A preview of the film. To play the most vile (if not the most clichéd) residents of this heat-hammered hellhole, the writer and director, <pname>Ivan Sen</pname>, smartly hired two virtual legends. As the ruthless mayor, <pname>Jacki Weaver</pname> is a weaponized <pname>Martha Stewart</pname>, masking the stink of mining-corporation corruption with the aroma of home-baked apple pies. Over at the local pleasure palace, <pname>Cheng Pei Pei</pname> is squeezed into the much smaller role of town madam. “The world was not made for you,” she admonishes one of her unhappy Chinese charges. “You were made for it.” It's a sentiment that <pname>Jay Swan</pname> (<pname>Aaron Pedersen</pname>), a perpetually sozzled Aboriginal detective, can appreciate. Distrusted by whites and blacks alike, he exhibits all the tics and trappings of the alienated loner, including a ratty trailer and a mistrust of personal hygiene. His uneasy alliance with <pname>Josh</pname> (<pname>Alex Russell</pname>), a morally conflicted white police officer, is the movie's thematic heart. Yet its sociopolitical concerns — primarily around indigenous land rights — are muted and muddled by a script that favors manly grunting and moody looks over clarifying dialogue. Riven with racism and sharp bursts of violence, “Goldstone” nevertheless has a rough, desolate beauty. Gorgeous aerial shots reveal a blasted and burnished expanse, as if all of the town's precious metal — unlike its crimes — lay nakedly, dazzlingly exposed.
