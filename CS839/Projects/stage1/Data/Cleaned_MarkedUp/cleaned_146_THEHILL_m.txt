 Six Democratic senators on Wednesday wrote to FBI Director <pname>Christopher Wray</pname> asking for a full list of White House staffers working without a full security clearance. Sens. <pname>Richard Blumenthal</pname> (Conn.), <pname>Tammy Baldwin</pname>    (Wis.), <pname>Martin Heinrich</pname>    (N.M.), <pname>Mazie Hirono</pname>    (Hawaii), <pname>Tom Udall</pname>    (N.M.) and <pname>Cory Booker</pname>    (N.J.) noted recent reports that indicated dozens of White House officials and appointees have been working in the <pname>Trump</pname> administration with interim security clearances. The letter asks for a list of those with interim clearances, as well as the status of FBI background investigations into those individuals. It specifically seeks information on the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, <pname>Jared Kushner</pname>   . “We are deeply concerned that high level officials operating under an interim security clearance, like <pname>Jared Kushner</pname>, read the President's daily intelligence briefing,” the senators wrote.
