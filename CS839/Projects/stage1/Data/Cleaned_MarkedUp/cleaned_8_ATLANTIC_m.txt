 Last week, The Washington Post reported that President <pname>Donald Trump</pname> had mimicked the accent of Indian Prime Minister <pname>Narendra Modi</pname>. Soon, several publications began to ask if the alleged incident could chill the leaders' warm relationship. Disturbingly, this wouldn't be <pname>Trump</pname>'s first brush with this very controversy—on the campaign trail in 2016, he entertained his base with an impression of an Indian call-center employee. While a rupture between Washington and New Delhi may not be in the cards—both countries' administrations recognize the value of an alliance as China grows more powerful—the stereotypical accent that <pname>Trump</pname> reportedly used merits some scrutiny. In the recent documentary The Problem With <pname>Apu</pname>, which takes to task the convenience-store owner of the same name on The Simpsons, the actress <pname>Sakina Jaffrey</pname> dubbed this type of common, broad, and ultra-exaggerated South Asian accent patanking. For those unfamiliar, patanking is characterized by a retreating tongue, stressed syllables shaken out of order, mixed V's and W's, and hammered-out A's. It tries to fold thousands of languages and dialects from eight countries into a single accent. (Of note, recent research from the University of Oregon upends common assumptions of a mere standard Indian accent.) As the media-studies professor <pname>Shilpa Davé</pname> writes in her book Indian Accents, race has a “loud and specific sound.” <pname>Trump</pname>'s reputed mockery serves as a deafening reminder of mainstream America's contempt for authentic South Asian accents. For decades, racists have weaponized an inaccurate, hyper-exaggerated version of so-called “brown voice” to caricature South Asians. Due to this long history, South Asian Americans tend to dismiss, dislike, or outright despise when non–South Asians decide to patank. Both <pname>Davé</pname> and The Problem With <pname>Apu</pname> note that patanking echoes, if not embodies, elements of minstrelsy. In this racist American comedic tradition, white performers donned blackface makeup and depicted America's black population as lazy and simple-minded. This tradition proved as versatile as it was demeaning. In the 1968 film The Party, <pname>Peter Sellers</pname> wore brownface and spoke in a dubious South Asian accent to play the clueless, bumbling Indian actor <pname>Hrundi V. Bakshi</pname>. <pname>Fisher Stevens</pname> followed suit when playing <pname>Ben Jabituya</pname> in the 1986 film Short Circuit. More recently, <pname>Ashton Kutcher</pname> wore brownface to play an eligible bachelor named “<pname>Raj</pname>” in an infamous 2012 Popchips ad. As The Problem With <pname>Apu</pname> writer and star <pname>Hari Kondabolu</pname> argues, <pname>Apu</pname>, voiced by the white actor <pname>Hank Azaria</pname>, is likely this trend's most enduring emblem—a “devious, servile, [and] goofy” incarnation of South Asian stereotypes, whose only sin is to be Indian.
