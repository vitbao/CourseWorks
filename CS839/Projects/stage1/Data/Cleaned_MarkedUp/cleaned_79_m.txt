   It's a dog-eat-dog world out there, and <pname>Wes Anderson</pname> has made those canines the subject of his new film Isle of Dogs, the director's first stop-motion feature since the warmly received Fantastic Mr. Fox. In this exclusive first clip from the film, you'll get a sense of the unique Isle of Dogs setting: <pname>Anderson</pname> has fashioned an alternate version of Japan where the country's flu-ridden dogs have been quarantined on an island all their own. Alas, this is no four-legged paradise: Rex (<pname>Edward Norton</pname>) and his pals fight other dogs for maggot-ridden scraps in a grim, colorless world until a human boy crash-lands on the island and gives these good boys a reason to sit up straight. Isle of Dogs will open the Berlin Film Festival on February 15, but domestic dog lovers will have their crack at <pname>Anderson</pname>'s film when it debuts Stateside on March 23.
