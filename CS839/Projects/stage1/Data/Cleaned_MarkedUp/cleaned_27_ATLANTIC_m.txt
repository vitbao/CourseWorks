 If Hollywood is looking for a pop-culture role model in 2018, it could do worse than <pname>Paddington Bear</pname>, the adorable CGI version of the classic British children's character. He's voiced by <pname>Ben Whishaw</pname>, hails from “darkest Peru,” wears a pair of spectacles, is fond of orange-marmalade sandwiches, and, as his adoptive father <pname>Henry</pname> (<pname>Hugh Bonneville</pname>) puts it, “He looks for the good in all of us and he finds it.” The good can be hard to spot these days, but in Paddington 2, our furry friend does his best to bring it out anyway. <pname>Paddington</pname>, a diminutive cartoon bear created by <pname>Michael Bond</pname> in 1958, has found a new life on the big screen in this ongoing series of films written and directed by <pname>Paul King</pname>. The first <pname>Paddington</pname>, released in the U.S. in 2015, was a surprisingly timely tale of a stuffy British family learning to welcome into their home a foreign refugee who happens to be a two-foot-tall bear. <pname>Paddington</pname> was originally inspired by the stories of children evacuated from British cities to the countryside in World War II, but in a Britain grappling with Brexit, he felt relevant in an entirely new way. In <pname>Paddington</pname> 2, the allegorical thrust is milder, but this is still a tale about the importance of community and, as <pname>Henry</pname> put it, <pname>Paddington</pname>'s gift for seeing past a person's surface. It's a lovely children's film that neither condescends to a younger audience, nor makes cheap, glib attempts to reel in an older one. <pname>King</pname> leans on his strengths—strong characterization and grand visual storytelling—to win the viewer over, and it's hard to resist. <pname>King</pname>, who came up in the British comedy world (he directed almost every episode of the wonderful TV show The Mighty Boosh), has such an attention to detail when it comes to production design: Every scene pops with color, every set is meticulously constructed. The London of <pname>Paddington</pname> 2 is frozen in a nostalgic moment just a step removed from reality—modern, but overflowing with whimsy. <pname>Paddington</pname> lives in a Notting Hill neighborhood filled with friendly neighbors (and one grumpy busybody played by <pname>Peter Capaldi</pname>) that feels the right amount of fanciful.
