 Sen. <pname>Chuck Grassley</pname>    (R-Iowa) on Wednesday torched Attorney General <pname>Jeff Sessions</pname>    for his “attempt to undermine” a bipartisan drug sentencing reform bill. “Incensed by <pname>Sessions</pname> letter An attempt to undermine <pname>Grassley</pname>/<pname>Durbin</pname>/<pname>Lee</pname> BIPARTISAN criminal justice reforms This bill deserves thoughtful consideration b4 my cmte. AGs execute laws CONGRESS WRITES THEM!” <pname>Grassley</pname> tweeted. In a letter sent to <pname>Grassley</pname> on Wednesday, <pname>Sessions</pname> wrote that legislation proposed by <pname>Grassley</pname> and Senate Democratic Whip <pname>Dick Durbin</pname>    (Ill.) would be a “grave error” and urged the Senate to reconsider the bill. The attorney general said the bill weakens the punishments for criminals and risks allowing the “very worst criminals” back into society by allowing judges to retroactively reduce sentences. The legislation, reintroduced last year after previously failing in the Senate, would reduce mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent offenders and end the mandatory three strikes rule that calls for repeat offenders to be sentenced to life in prison. Sen. <pname>Mike Lee</pname>    (R-Utah) has also indicated support. <pname>Grassley</pname> says the legislation would allow "nonviolent offenders with minimal criminal histories a better chance to become productive members of society. "<pname>Sessions</pname>, who has staked out his attorney general legacy as being tough on crime, argued the bill makes it easier for "serious drug traffickers" to re-enter society. “The bill weakens penalties for repeat, serious drug traffickers, including those who used a gun and those with significant criminal histories, and would reduce the sentences of and potentially allow for the early release of many dangerous felons in prison now, including heroin traffickers, firearms felons, and those who are members of violent drug cartels and gangs like MS-13,” <pname>Session</pname> wrote. “Passing this legislation to further reduce sentences for drug traffickers in the midst of the worst drug crisis in our nation's history would make it more difficult to achieve our goals and have potentially dire consequences,” he said.
