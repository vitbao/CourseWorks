 Viewers don't meet <pname>Winston Churchill</pname> (<pname>Gary Oldman</pname>) for the first 10 minutes of his new biopic, Darkest Hour. The director <pname>Joe Wright</pname> (Pride & Prejudice, Atonement) wants to give the British leader an appropriate drumroll: The film melds impressive archival footage of troop buildup in Europe as the Second World War gets underway with scenes in Parliament of Prime Minister <pname>Neville Chamberlain</pname> stepping down and debate raging over who his successor should be. <pname>Churchill</pname> is the only man palatable to the opposition parties, but he's a horror to the reigning Conservatives, including the stuffy Lord <pname>Halifax</pname> (<pname>Stephen Dillane</pname>), who commiserates with <pname>Chamberlain</pname> over the brute they're about to invite into their midst. In short, <pname>Churchill</pname>'s reputation precedes him—both in Britain in 1940 and for any viewer watching today—and <pname>Wright</pname> knows that.
