 <pname>Dee Rees</pname>'s Mudbound opens in media res: Two sparring brothers, <pname>Jamie</pname> (<pname>Garrett Hedlund</pname>) and <pname>Henry McAllan</pname> (<pname>Jason Clarke</pname>), are trying to bury their father on their Mississippi farm by digging a grave during a rainstorm. The entire endeavor is tinged with futility, as the horrible weather seemingly mocks their efforts. While they struggle, the African American <pname>Jackson</pname> family rides by with all their possessions strapped to their buggy as if they're fleeing the farm. <pname>Henry</pname>—who is white—sees them and asks the patriarch <pname>Hap Jackson</pname> (<pname>Rob Morgan</pname>) for help. Even with little context for the moment, viewers can tell from the look on <pname>Hap</pname>'s face and the '40s period setting just how big a line <pname>Henry</pname> is crossing. It's just as easy to see that, despite the quiet insult, <pname>Hap</pname> can't decline. Mudbound, which debuted on Netflix and in limited theaters last weekend, is an old-fashioned epic drama about race relations in the 1940s Deep South, adapted from <pname>Hillary Jordan</pname>'s 2008 novel. The film touches on the evil of the <pname>Jim Crow</pname> era, the oft-ignored post-traumatic stress suffered by servicemen returning from World War II, and the stifling sexism of the time. Mudbound is beautifully shot, well-acted, and surprisingly sweeping for a movie with a relatively small budget of $10 million; if it's guilty of anything, it's perhaps trying to do too much at once, which is understandable given its novelistic scope.
