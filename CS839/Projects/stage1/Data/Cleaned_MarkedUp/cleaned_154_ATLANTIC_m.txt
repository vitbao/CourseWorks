 “We have to be the check on their power. If we don't hold them accountable, who will?” These words are spoken by the legendary Washington Post editor <pname>Ben Bradlee</pname> in <pname>Steven Spielberg</pname>'s movie about the Pentagon Papers, The Post. (For those of you thinking, Wait, didn't The New York Times break that story? Patience: We'll get there.) Lest there be any doubt that <pname>Bradlee</pname> is speaking on behalf not only of his paper or journalism generally but also of Honor, Decency, and the American Way, he is played by <pname>Tom Hanks</pname>, who has over time become Hollywood's designated embodiment of All That Is Good. (Remember <pname>Sully</pname>? This is him but with a Boston Brahmin accent in place of the mustache.) Indeed, The Post is so on the nose for the political moment that at times it almost seems it might have been produced not by <pname>Spielberg</pname>, but by some high-end marketing firm. It's not only a <pname>Trump</pname>-era defense of the essential role played by the free press. (Although only seen briefly in silhouette through the window of the Oval Office, <pname>Dick Nixon</pname> casts a long shadow over the whole film.) It is also the story of a personally insecure and professionally underestimated woman, the longtime Post publisher <pname>Katharine “Kay” Graham</pname> (<pname>Meryl Streep</pname>), who discovers that she is as strong—in most cases, stronger—as any of the men around her. (Thus: The Post. The Times' sole meaningful character in the movie is its editor, <pname>Abe Rosenthal</pname>.) None of which is to say that The Post is a bad movie. It's actually a rather good one, just one that is deeply self-congratulatory in a particularly Hollywood fashion. In part for that reason, I wouldn't rank it in the top tier of films about journalism—Spotlight, The Insider, All the President's Men—although it is solidly in the tier immediately below. That is no small feat, considering that most movies about journalism have no clue, and evidently not much interest, in how journalism actually works.
