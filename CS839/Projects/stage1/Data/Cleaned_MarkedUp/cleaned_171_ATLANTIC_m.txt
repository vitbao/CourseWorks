 Over the next month, The Atlantic's “And, Scene” series will delve into some of the most interesting films of the year by examining a single, noteworthy moment and unpacking what it says about 2017. Next up is <pname>Olivier Assayas</pname>'s Personal Shopper. (Read our previous entries here.) When Personal Shopper begins, <pname>Maureen Cartwright</pname> (<pname>Kristen Stewart</pname>) has been waiting a long time for a sign. A few months prior, her twin brother <pname>Lewis</pname> died from a genetic heart defect, a condition she also possesses. Both siblings were mediums, with a connection to the spirit world, and they had promised each other that “whoever died first would send the other a sign,” she explains to a friend. As she waits, <pname>Maureen</pname> works the film's titular job, cruising around Paris on a motorcycle to buy clothes and accessories for her celebrity client. But she's also looking for her brother anywhere she can, even spending a night at his empty former home to see if he's returned to haunt it.
