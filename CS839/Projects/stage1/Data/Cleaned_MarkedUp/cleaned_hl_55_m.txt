  With an embargo now lifted, let me express some real deference towards what Sir <pname>Ridley Scott</pname> was able to do with All the Money in the World at the 11th hour. His decision to recast a crucial role, essentially firing <pname>Kevin Spacey</pname> months after production had ended and replacing him with <pname>Christopher Plummer</pname>, mere weeks before release, seemed misguided at best and a disaster at worst. Yet, here we are, three Golden Globe nominations later. Having seen the film last week, I can vouch for it being pretty good. When you think about what <pname>Plummer</pname> and <pname>Scott</pname> pulled off at the last minute though, that helps to set it apart.  <pname>Scott</pname> deserves a lot of credit for what he's done here. The film itself is solid, an above average effort for the veteran director. It's often compelling, though drags a lot in the middle. It has a great central performance by <pname>Williams</pname>, who is the heart and soul of the picture, while <pname>Plummer</pname> is a commanding force in a supporting turn. That's all well and good. However, the effort level is astounding, considering how he put <pname>Plummer</pname> in the role only a month ago, firing <pname>Spacey</pname> while in post production after his controversies threatened to derail the picture. That fact that you can barely tell there were any reshoots is a testament to <pname>Scott</pname> and company.
