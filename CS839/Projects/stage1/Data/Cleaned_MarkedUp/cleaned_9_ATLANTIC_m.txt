 The life that <pname>Orlando</pname> (<pname>Francisco Reyes</pname>) has built with his girlfriend, <pname>Marina</pname> (<pname>Daniela Vega</pname>), which viewers glimpse in the opening 15 minutes of A Fantastic Woman, has a warm sense of stability. <pname>Orlando</pname> relaxes at a spa, then heads over to a bar where he watches <pname>Marina</pname>, a singer, perform. They celebrate her birthday at a Chinese restaurant, then head home to their apartment. Their relationship (he's a cisgender man in his 50s, she's a transgender woman in her late 20s) feels quiet, but not secret; it's something they've carved out together, free of judgment. There's a safe tranquility to these early scenes; the Chilean director <pname>Sebastián Lelio</pname> films them as a gauzy fantasia. The spa and the restaurant are both subterranean and lit in soft neon: They're enchantingly private realms, and <pname>Orlando</pname> is planning a vacation to another magical place, the Iguazu Falls (which <pname>Lelio</pname> uses as the backdrop for his opening credits). But when <pname>Orlando</pname> suddenly collapses at home and dies of an aneurysm, the wider world comes rushing in, and the effect is both heartbreaking and enraging. “Are you a member of Mr. <pname>Orlando</pname>'s family?” the ER doctor asks <pname>Marina</pname>. “Yes.” “Are you his partner?” “Yes, we're partners,” she replies. “Sorry, your name is … ?” “<pname>Marina Vidal</pname>.” A long pause. “But … that's a nickname?” The gentle world <pname>Lelio</pname> has created quickly falls away; the next shot is of <pname>Marina</pname>, devastated, washing her face under the harsh light of the hospital bathroom. A Fantastic Woman, nominated in the Best Foreign Language Film category at this year's Academy Awards, is a tremendous portrait of grief and prejudice. It's also an incredible showcase for <pname>Vega</pname>, who excels in a role that's unfortunately rare in film—as a trans character who's more than the butt of a joke or an exoticized other. This isn't to say that <pname>Lelio</pname> shies away from the prejudice <pname>Marina</pname> faces from most of Chilean society. Her very existence is callously called into question in the home she shared with <pname>Orlando</pname>, which his son from a previous marriage comes to claim as his inheritance. “I don't know what you are!” the son yells at her. “I'm the same as you,” she replies calmly, absorbing a blow that she's obviously received many times in her life. <pname>Marina</pname> is taunted, challenged, and even threatened as she tries to pick up the pieces in the wake of <pname>Orlando</pname>'s death, and <pname>Leilo</pname>'s triumph as a filmmaker is allowing her to be aching vulnerable at times and bitterly tough at others: not a cartoon hero or a grieving caricature, but a whole person caught up in one of the worst weeks of her life.
