 This story contains spoilers for all of The Last Jedi. In the days before The Last Jedi opened in theaters, three Star Wars fans who go by <pname>Rosie</pname>, <pname>Ricca</pname>, and <pname>Trebia</pname> started receiving messages online from people who'd seen the film early. The gist, as <pname>Rosie</pname> described it: “How does it feel to have your fan fiction turned into a movie?” <pname>Rosie</pname>, 28, and <pname>Ricca</pname>, 29, are the authors of Interstellar Transmissions, which on the leading fan-fiction site Archive of Our Own is the most widely read story inspired by Star Wars's Episode VII, The Force Awakens. <pname>Trebia</pname>, 26, is the author of Forms, another popular piece of fan fiction crafted immediately after Disney's 2015 franchise reboot. Both stories focus on the scrappy scavenger <pname>Rey</pname> and the villainous <pname>Skywalker</pname> heir <pname>Kylo Ren</pname> discovering they share a telepathic bond across the galaxy, and then teaming up to defeat Supreme Leader <pname>Snoke</pname>. Sound familiar? The Last Jedi has the saga's rising “good guy”—or girl, in this case—supernaturally backchanneling with its rising bad guy. <pname>Rey</pname> and <pname>Kylo</pname> build some sort of trust, and then <pname>Kylo</pname> betrays his boss, <pname>Snoke</pname>, as she hoped he would. The fact that well-read fan writers and Disney's professional writers came up with such similar stories is, among other things, a testament to the ways <pname>Rey</pname> and <pname>Kylo Ren</pname> represent something fundamental—as well as vitally new—about Star Wars.
