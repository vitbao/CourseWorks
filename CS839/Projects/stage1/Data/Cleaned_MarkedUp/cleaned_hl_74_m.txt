 There are times when the prognostication world anoints a presumed Oscar winner, only to have the film or the performance fall flat when actually seen. Then, there are other times when the movie or performer meets expectations and the victor should begin writing up their speech for the Academy Awards. More often than not, the former winds up being true. Gary Oldman is a case of the latter, as his turn in Darkest Hour is 100% going to win him the Oscar for Best Actor. It's just a done deal, Academy wise. Beginning its theatrical run today, it's also a quality biopic that's more than simply shameless awards bait.  The film is a look at British Prime Minister <pname>Winston Churchill</pname> (Oldman), how he came to power during the early days of World War II, and his agonizing decision over whether to negotiate with <pname>Hitler</pname> or fight on. The last choice of his party to replace <pname>Neville Chamberlain</pname> (<pname>Ronald Pickup</pname>), who all much prefer <pname>Viscount Halifax</pname> (<pname>Stephen Dillane</pname>), <pname>Churchill</pname> is immediately up against a wall. <pname>Chamberlain</pname> and <pname>Halifax</pname> are pursuing negotiations with the Nazis, something the new PM is deeply against. Even King <pname>George VI</pname> (<pname>Ben Mendelsohn</pname>) initially doesn't stand with <pname>Churchill</pname>. Supported by only his wife <pname>Clementine</pname> (<pname>Kristin Scott Thomas</pname>), he must find his footing and lead the nation in its…you guessed it…darkest hour. <pname>Joe Wright</pname> directs a script by <pname>Anthony McCarten</pname>. <pname>Lily James</pname> has a main supporting role. <pname>Dario Marianelli</pname> composed the score, while Bruno Delbonnel handles the cinematography.
