  We're reaching the point in the year where some top notch counter programming is about to be released. In fact, today we get one of 2017's best films overall in The Big Sick. This movie is a supremely entertaining romantic comedy that quickly reveals itself to be much more than just that. At the beginning, it's a <pname>Judd Apatow</pname> production through and through, and one of his better ones (among the ones he's just produced). Then, about halfway in, it takes a right turn that separates it from the pack. Before that, it still would be quality entertainment, but this second half makes it damn near awards worthy. Yes, this movie is just that good.  Once again, here is a quick summation for The Big Sick. This film is based on the real life relationship between <pname>Emily V. Gordon</pname> and <pname>Kumail Nanjiani</pname>. We're introduced to the latter as <pname>Kumail</pname> (<pname>Nanjiani</pname> playing himself) is toiling as a struggling stand up. When he's heckled in the crowd by <pname>Emily</pname> (<pname>Zoe Kazan</pname>), an instant spark is there. Neither wants to commit to anything serious, but neither can deny the chemistry they share. At the same time, <pname>Kumail</pname> is dealing with an endless parade of Pakistani women that his mother <pname>Sharmeen</pname> (<pname>Zenobia Shroff</pname>) is inviting over for the dinner, in the hopes of an arranged marriage. That pressure eventually spills over and ends things for <pname>Emily</pname> and <pname>Kumail</pname>, but when the former winds up in the hospital, it's <pname>Kumail</pname> who has to sign papers putting her in a medically induced coma. <pname>Emily</pname>'s parents <pname>Terry</pname> (<pname>Ray Romano</pname>) and <pname>Beth</pname> (<pname>Holly Hunter</pname>) then arrive, ready to send their daughter's ex on his way. Something in him tells him to stay though, and as <pname>Emily</pname> fights for her life, <pname>Kumail</pname> gets to know <pname>Beth</pname> and <pname>Terry</pname>, seeing an influence on <pname>Emily</pname> that he never realized. I won't say where it goes, but considering the real life people are pretty public about things, you should be able to guess.<pname>Michael Showalter</pname> directs a script that <pname>Gordon</pname> and <pname>Nanjiani</pname> co-wrote together. The aforementioned <pname>Apatow</pname> produces.
