 <pname>Christine McPherson</pname> (<pname>Saoirse Ronan</pname>) is someone cursed with that familiar, often painful, gift of youth—absolute certainty. She feels everything strongly, expresses her opinions loudly, and both wounds and charms the people around her without meaning to. On the brink of adulthood, she's resolute enough about her desire to go to college on the East Coast (far from her home of Sacramento) that she tosses herself out of a moving car when her mother <pname>Marion</pname> (<pname>Laurie Metcalf</pname>) tries to dismiss her ambitions. Another movie might frame that moment as frightening or foolish, but <pname>Greta Gerwig</pname>'s <pname>Lady Bird</pname> celebrates <pname>Christine</pname>'s teenage will, no matter how extreme it can sometimes be. <pname>Christine</pname> prefers to be called “<pname>Lady Bird</pname>,” which she considers her “given name” (“I gave it to myself, it was given to me by me,” she explains). She wants to be an actress, but keeps getting small, nameless roles in the school plays; she wants to go to a university like Yale, but probably not Yale, since her grades aren't good enough to get in. She's constantly boiling with passions that bounce off her weary mother, a nurse, and her good-natured if passive father (<pname>Tracy Letts</pname>), an out-of-work computer programmer.
