  Merry Christmas! As you open your presents, a really terrific film is also opening today, in theaters. It's <pname>Molly</pname>'s Game, the directorial debut of ace scribe <pname>Aaron Sorkin</pname>. Long considered one of the best writers in Hollywood, he's moved behind the camera to direct this drama, becoming a full fledged filmmaker. <pname>Sorkin</pname> makes a terrific debut here too, showing he's just a strong a director, which is exciting to consider when thinking about his future. Now out in theaters, it's potentially an awards player too. If that doesn't scream must see, I don't know what does. This is a flick not to miss, ladies and gentlemen.  The film is a biopic of <pname>Molly Bloom</pname> (<pname>Jessica Chastain</pname>), a former Olympic quality skier who ended up running some of the most notorious poker games in the country. In adapting her memoir, the movie showcases <pname>Molly</pname> going from a mere assistant in an underground poker game run by <pname>Dean Keith</pname> (<pname>Jeremy Strong</pname>) to eventually operating highly successful ones of her own, first in Los Angeles, and then in New York. Her clientele was exclusively high class figures, including famous celebrities like Player X (<pname>Michael Cera</pname>) and, apparently unbeknownst to her, the mob. When the FBI comes down on her one night, she's essentially ruined. Looking for help, she's eventually defended by a skeptical attorney in <pname>Charlie Jaffey</pname> (<pname>Idris Elba</pname>), someone who sees through her act. Through it all, her father <pname>Larry</pname> (<pname>Kevin Costnr</pname>) looms large. <pname>Sorkin</pname> adapted <pname>Bloom</pname>'s memoir, as mentioned above, and directs here, also as previously discussed.   I'm really fond of this movie. It pairs <pname>Chastain</pname> and <pname>Sorkin</pname> together, which is a perfect match. <pname>Chastain</pname> feasts on his dialogue, eating it up with a spoon. Her gusto for the part is evident. <pname>Sorkin</pname> also proves a surprisingly solid visual stylist, never getting in the way of the script, but never being a slave to it either. <pname>Chastain</pname> is as good as ever. The film goes on a little long and doesn't quite stick the landing (no pun intended) with the ending, but it's still a very good picture.
