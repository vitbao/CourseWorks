  A preview of the film. Wreck-It Ralph is heading online. Disney has just released the first teaser trailer for the sequel to the Oscar-nominated 2012 cartoon. <pname>John C. Reilly</pname> returns as the voice of <pname>Ralph</pname>, a former video game villain trying to go good, with <pname>Sarah Silverman</pname> reprising her sidekick, <pname>Vanellope von Schweet</pname>. This time, the former arcade characters are invading the internet, à la “Tron,” another Disney property. They learn about new terms like Wi-Fi (which <pname>Ralph</pname> mispronounces “wifey”) and sites like eBay, where a black velvet painting of a sad kitten is being auctioned off. Even more sadly, they're also assaulted by the animated equivalent of clickbait, as annoying figures urge them to check out contest offers and listicles about child stars who went to prison. There's no sight nor sound yet of <pname>Yesss</pname>, a new character (voiced by <pname>Taraji P. Henson</pname>) who heads up the cutting-edge website Buzztube, but perhaps we'll see and hear from her when Disney releases a longer trailer closer to the sequel's release. The seemingly backwards-titled “Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2” will be downloaded into theaters just in time for the online shopping season: Thanksgiving.
