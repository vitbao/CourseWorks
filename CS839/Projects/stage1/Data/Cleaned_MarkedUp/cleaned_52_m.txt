   In an interview so sweet your teeth will fall out, which would be perfect for <pname>Christopher Rivera</pname>'s zombie movie, A24 asked The Florida Project's kid stars <pname>Brooklynn Prince</pname>, <pname>Valeria Cotto</pname>, and <pname>Rivera</pname> to pitch their dream project. While <pname>Cotto</pname>'s anti-bullying drama and <pname>Rivera</pname>'s zombie apocalypse action flick are both important films about important topics, 7-year-old <pname>Brooklynn Prince</pname>'s idea has all the makings of a must-see picture, specifically <pname>Emma Watson</pname> and <pname>John Boyega</pname> falling in love in a Broadway musical rom-com. Shooting on a slender budget of “$14,000 or $1,400” on “Broadway Street,” <pname>Prince</pname>'s film would be “a kinda like romance-comedy. It's about a Broadway star and a set producer, or a stage manager, who the daughter loves hanging out with, so you know, they end up falling in love and yeah.” <pname>Elle Fanning</pname> and <pname>Daniel Kaluuya</pname> would round out the cast alongside <pname>Watson</pname> and <pname>Boyega</pname>, who <pname>Prince</pname> points out is her “Man Crush Monday,” because she is a filmmaker with her finger on the pulse of modern cinema.
