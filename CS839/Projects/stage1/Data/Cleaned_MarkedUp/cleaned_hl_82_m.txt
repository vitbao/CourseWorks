  Netflix fascinates me, especially when it comes to their hopes at Academy Award attention. This is something I previously wrote about the service: “There's a notable difference between the types of projects that Amazon and Netflix have been putting out, theatrically speaking. On the one hand, Amazon has been gunning for awards and embracing a theatrical release with things like the Oscar winner Manchester by the Sea. There's also their burgeoning relationship with an auteur like <pname>Woody Allen</pname>. It's a whole concerted effort under their Amazon Studios wing. On the other hand, Netflix has gone for casting a wider net, while only occasionally putting their higher profile films out in theaters, like Beasts of No Nation or this year's Okja. They only once in a while look at things with an awards type view. So far, they've either come up short with would be players like War Machine, or seen things like Beasts of No Nation snubbed.” This week, they not only put an awards hopeful out in theaters, but they're actually giving it a real push. That title is Mudbound, and it's a dandy.  The film is a 1940's set melodrama about two southern families and the racial divides that exist. IMDb lists the plot as “Two men return home from World War II to work on a farm in rural Mississippi, where they struggle to deal with racism and adjusting to life after war.” Those men are<pname>Ronsel Jackson</pname> (<pname>Jason Mitchell</pname>) and <pname>Jamie McAllan</pname> (<pname>Garrett Hedlund</pname>). <pname>Ronsel</pname> lives with his mother <pname>Florence</pname> (<pname>Mary J. Blige</pname>) and <pname>Hap</pname> (<pname>Rob Morgan</pname>), who work on the farm owned by <pname>Jamie</pname>'s older brother <pname>Henry</pname> (<pname>Jason Clarke</pname>). Also on hand are <pname>Henry</pname>'s wife <pname>Laura</pname> (<pname>Carey Mulligan</pname>) and the boys' father <pname>Pappy</pname> (<pname>Jonathan Banks</pname>). How these families interact I will leave for you to discover, but it's all very moving. <pname>Dee Rees</pname> co-writes with <pname>Virgil Williams</pname> and directs. <pname>Rachel Morrison</pname> contributes some terrific cinematography, while the score is by <pname>Tamar-Kali Brown</pname>.
