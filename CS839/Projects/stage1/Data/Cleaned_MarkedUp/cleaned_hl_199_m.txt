 A few days ago, shocking news broke that filmmakers <pname>Phil Lord</pname> and <pname>Chris Miller</pname> were being removed from the untitled Young Han Solo movie that they were currently in production on. This is pretty shocking stuff, to be frank. Even with the chaos of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story last year, <pname>Kathleen Kennedy</pname> and company didn't replace <pname>Gareth Edwards</pname> during the shooting of the picture. That happened here though, as <pname>Lord</pname> and <pname>Miller</pname> are out. What does this mean? We shall see, but the search is (quickly) on for a replacement. Whomever gets the job will finish the last few weeks of production and then handle the post production work. It's going to be a challenge, to say the least. Hopefully the person who comes on board the ship won't crash it, as plenty is riding on this tale of a young smugglerâ€¦ Here now are a half dozen options to replace <pname>Lord</pname> and <pname>Miller</pname>, some of whom have been mentioned already, while some are just my suggestions.
