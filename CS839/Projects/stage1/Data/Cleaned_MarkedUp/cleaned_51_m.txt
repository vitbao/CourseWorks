   According to Variety, <pname>Elisabeth Moss</pname> will star as the titular lead in the upcoming biopic A Letter From Rosemary Kennedy, which explores the life of <pname>John F. Kennedy</pname>'s sister through her personal writings. Eldest daughter of the Kennedy clan, <pname>Rose Marie Kennedy</pname>, known as <pname>Rosemary</pname>, reportedly exhibited behavioral and intellectual disabilities throughout her childhood and adolescence. At her father <pname>Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.</pname>'s behest, she received a prefrontal lobotomy at the age of 23. The procedure left her severely disabled and <pname>Rosemary</pname> lived out the rest of her life at an institution in Jefferson, Wisconsin, reportedly sequestered from her siblings for two decades before reuniting. Her sister <pname>Eunice</pname> would go on to create the Special Olympics in the 1960s. Back in 2016 <pname>Emma Stone</pname> was initially rumored to be playing the lead in the film, based on a Black List script by screenwriter <pname>Nick Yarborough</pname>. This post has been corrected to show that <pname>Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.</pname>, not <pname>John Kennedy Sr.</pname>, was <pname>Rosemary Kennedy</pname>'s father.  Sources  Variety
