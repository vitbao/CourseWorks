  Yesterday evening, during halftime of Monday Night Football, a brand new Trailer dropped for Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Episode VIII in the Saga, this film builds upon the massive and record breaking success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Remember, that movie is the biggest one of all time, at least domestically at the box office. Could The Last Jedi be even bigger? Believe it or not, there's a good chance that that's the case. You can see the new Trailer at the bottom of this post, but before that…it's time to discuss what next is going down a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. Once again for those living under a rock where this franchise isn't a part of pop culture, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is the next installment in the main portion of the Star Wars Saga. It will detail what happens after <pname>Rey</pname> (<pname>Daisy Ridley</pname>) encounters <pname>Luke Skywalker</pname> (<pname>Mark Hamill</pname>), now living in exile. Obviously, the Resistance, led by <pname>General Leia</pname> (<pname>Carrie Fisher</pname>) is still fighting the First Order, so the former will have <pname>Finn</pname> (<pname>John Boyega</pname>) and <pname>Poe</pname> (<pname>Oscar Isaac</pname>) part of the effort taking on <pname>Kylo Ren</pname> (<pname>Adam Driver</pname>), <pname>General Hux</pname> (<pname>Domhnall Gleeson</pname>), <pname>Captain Phasma</pname> (<pname>Gwendolyn Christie</pname>), and company, all of whom are under the rule of <pname>Supreme Leader Snoke</pname> (<pname>Andy Serkis</pname>).   Judging by the Trailer, this does seem very much like The Empire Strikes Back, much like The Force Awakens had more than a touch of A New Hope in it. There's also the requisite cute new toy push, what with these Porgs. Aside from that, it looks dark and kind of fantastic. This could be something special. In <pname>Johnson</pname>'s hands, we might get elevated material, which is saying something. Believe it or not, a Best Picture nomination wouldn't be impossible if that's the case. There's also the little matter of this being <pname>Fisher</pname>'s goodbye, though that goes beyond awards. Tears will be shed.  Could we see Star Wars: The Last Jedi emerge as a true Oscar player? Disney will undoubtedly launch a major campaign, centered around Best Picture, Best Director (for <pname>Johnson</pname>), Best Actress (for <pname>Ridley</pname>), Best Supporting Actor (for <pname>Hamill</pname>), Best Supporting Actress (for <pname>Fisher</pname>), Best Adapted Screenplay (also for <pname>Johnson</pname>), Best Production Design, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Makeup & Hairstyling, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Original Score, and Best Visual Effects. Of course, it'll be a technical player at the Academy Awards, but those major categories will be what you'll want to watch out for. If it can crack those lineups, that would be something indeed. You'll be able to see the new Trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi momentarily, though the full film won't be out until mid December. The wait seems unbearable, considering how great this looks. <pname>Johnson</pname> appears to have knocked it out of the park. The next few months will see a deluge of material on this latest episode in the Saga, but I'm more than sold already. When you check out this Trailer, you'll understand why. Give it a look and sit tight for lots more. Star Wars fever will be caught before long all around the world. Sign me up in a big way. December can't come soon enough… Here now is the Star Wars: The Last Jedi Trailer:   Stay tuned for much more on Star War: The Last Jedi between now and its December 15th release date!
