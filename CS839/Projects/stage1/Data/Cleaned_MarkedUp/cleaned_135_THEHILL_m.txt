 A writer for "<pname>Jimmy Kimmel</pname> Live!" is calling out lawmakers for the money they've taken from the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the wake of a mass shooting at a South Florida high school. <pname>Bess Kalb</pname> on Wednesday responded to tweets from multiple GOP lawmakers expressing their thoughts and prayers after the shooting by tweeting the amount of money they have taken from the NRA, The Huffington Post reported. "This is not a political issue. This is not a Constitutional debate. This is a pandemic that's killing children," she tweeted Wednesday. "And it's perpetrated by hypocrites who preach a doctrine of 'life' but take money from a profit-driven gun lobby." In a subsequent tweet, she shared a list of lawmakers who have received NRA funding. God have mercy on your NRA-kept souls: <pname>Richard Burr</pname>   $6,986,620 <pname>Roy Blunt</pname>   $4,551,146 <pname>Thom Tillis</pname>   $4,418,012 <pname>Cory Gardner</pname>   $3,879,064 <pname>Marco Rubio</pname>   $3,303,355 <pname>Joni Ernst</pname>   $3,124,273 <pname>Rob Portman</pname>   $3,061,941 <pname>Todd Young</pname>   $2,896,732 <pname>Bill Cassidy</pname>   $2,861,047 https://t.co/y9US2i6CPD— <pname>Bess Kalb</pname> (@bessbell) February 14, 2018 She then responded to multiple tweets from lawmakers — including Sens. <pname>Marco Rubio</pname> (R-Fla.) and <pname>Cory Gardner</pname> (R-Colo.) — listing the amount they have taken from the NRA. She also responded to Republican National Committee Chairwoman <pname>Ronna Romney McDaniel</pname>, who tweeted she was praying for all those affected by the Florida shooting. "In the 2015-2016 election cycle alone, GOP candidates took $17,385,437 from the NRA," she replied. "This is NOT counting the $21 million given to President <pname>Trump</pname>   ," she added in a subsequent tweet. <pname>Kalb</pname>'s tweets are similar to those of The New York Daily News, which also highlighted contributions that senators, including <pname>Rubio</pname> and <pname>Rob Portman</pname> (R-Ohio), have received from the NRA and other gun rights groups after the senators' Wednesday tweets. At least 17 people were killed and even more wounded on Wednesday in a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. President <pname>Trump</pname> and many other lawmakers on Wednesday offered their thoughts and prayers to the victims. Multiple Democratic lawmakers have since called for Congress to take action on gun violence.
