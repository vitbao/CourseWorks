 Before <pname>Louis C.K.</pname> said, late last week, that “these stories are true,” he said that the stories were lies. During a 2016 interview with New York magazine, which asked <pname>C.K.</pname> about rumors of sexual harassment that had been circulating around him for years: “I don't care about that. That's nothing to me. That's not real.” During a 2017 interview with The New York Times, after the comedian <pname>Tig Notaro</pname> mentioned those rumors in a conversation with with The Daily Beast: “I don't know why she said the things she's said. … I don't think talking about that stuff in the press and having conversations over press lanes is a good idea.” During that same interview: “I'm not going to answer to that stuff, because they're rumors. If you actually participate in a rumor, you make it bigger and you make it real.” What's striking, through the jaded lens of retrospect, is how well <pname>C.K.</pname>'s protests—<pname>Louis</pname>, the victim of salacious gossip; <pname>Louis</pname>, the indignant genius; <pname>Louis</pname>, the affable guy who would never—seemed to track. <pname>C.K.</pname>, after all, dressed the part of an ally. “To many,” the writer <pname>Lindsey V. Thompson</pname> put it, “<pname>Louis C.K.</pname> was one of the good guys.”
