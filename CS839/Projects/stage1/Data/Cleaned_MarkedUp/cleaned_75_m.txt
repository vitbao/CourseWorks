   <pname>Diane Kruger</pname> defended her Inglourious Basterds director <pname>Quentin Tarantino</pname> on Tuesday, saying that she had only a pleasant experience working on the film. When fellow <pname>Tarantino</pname> star <pname>Uma Thurman</pname> spoke to the New York Times over the weekend, she accused <pname>Harvey Weinstein</pname> of attacking her, and of burying footage of a life-threatening car wreck on the set of Kill Bill. The Times piece also reported that <pname>Tarantino</pname> spat in <pname>Thurman</pname>'s face and choked her himself for specific scenes. In a long interview with Deadline following the Times report, <pname>Tarantino</pname> responded to the allegations about his conduct on set, describing a time during filming Basterds when he explained to <pname>Kruger</pname> exactly why he had to choke her himself so it looked realistic. <pname>Kruger</pname> responded to the interview by posting a statement on Instagram. She said that she empathizes with <pname>Thurman</pname> and other victims of abuse, adding, “For the record however, I would like to say that my work experience with <pname>Quentin Tarantino</pname> was pure joy. He treated me with utter respect and never abused his power or forced me to do anything I wasn't comfortable with.”
