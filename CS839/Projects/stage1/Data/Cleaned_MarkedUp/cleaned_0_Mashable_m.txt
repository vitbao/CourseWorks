SEE ALSO: 'Black Panther' is a huge victory for representation in film After the tremendous success of Black Panther's opening weekend, <pname>Will Smith</pname> took to Instagram to share an inspiring message he himself heard from <pname>Nelson Mandela</pname> along with a video of himself geeking out about Black Panther and praising everyone who worked on Marvel's latest film.    I want to share something that <pname>Nelson Mandela</pname> said to me. . He said, “With the type of fame that you have attained it is important when you encounter your fans that you — Reach Your Hand Out and let them Feel Your Flesh.  You have to prove to them that you are REAL — because people can not aspire to anything they do not believe is Real.” . So I say to you, Congratulations! Enjoy this Transcendent Moment. Go into the streets... Touch them... Let them know that you are real! . @chadwickboseman, @michaelbjordan @lupitanyongo @letitiawright @danaigurira @danielkaluuya @im.angelabassett @andyserkis @winstoncduke @sterlingkbrown @rmorrison @therealstanlee @ludwiggoransson @iamruthecarter #blackpanther .

"I watched the film a couple of days ago, and damn near got brought to tears.
