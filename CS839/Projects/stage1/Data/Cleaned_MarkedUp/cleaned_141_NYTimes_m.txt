  Even before their car mows down a stranger on a deserted road after a New Year's Eve party, <pname>Lindsey</pname> and <pname>Jeff</pname> (<pname>Alex Essoe</pname> and <pname>Dylan McTee</pname>) are less than blissfully married. The fault lines are mainly financial — she's the breadwinner and he's a failed athlete reduced to drywalling their rambling fixer-upper — but they run deep. And when the near-fatal collision kicks loose a cascade of poor decisions and worse outcomes, the couple's increasingly violent behavior blooms as much from hidden resentments as visible threats. A preview of the film. Such is the premise of <pname>Julius Ramsay</pname>'s first feature, “Midnighters,” a twisty thriller with horror-movie flourishes. Inspired by a 2002 article in The Los Angeles Times, the story (by the director's brother <pname>Alston Ramsay</pname>, a former speechwriter who has worked for the Obama and Clinton administrations) swerves and double-clutches with daunting speed. When the accident victim turns out to have the couple's address in his pocket and a shady connection to <pname>Lindsey</pname>'s freeloading younger sister, <pname>Hannah</pname> (<pname>Perla Haney-Jardine</pname>), a scary situation turns terrifying. As tables turn and turn again — nudged along by a wolfish impostor (<pname>Ward Horton</pname>) and some creative torturing — the movie allows scant time to ponder each new tack. <pname>Jeff</pname> and <pname>Lindsey</pname>'s marriage feels long past its sell-by date, and <pname>Hannah</pname>'s culpability in their predicament is only hazily defined. But if the action sometimes feels rushed, the director of photography, <pname>Alexander Alexandrov</pname>, maximizes his small budget and dimly lighted New England locations. Whether in basement, garage or on darkly wooded road, his images are clean and clear; only trust him, and he'll show you which of these characters deserves to survive.
