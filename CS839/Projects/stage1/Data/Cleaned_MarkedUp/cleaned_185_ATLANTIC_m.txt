 The hero of <pname>Roman J. Israel</pname>, Esq. looks like he emerged out of a time tunnel straight from 1979. He wears baggy three-piece suits, sports an afro, and never goes anywhere without his Walkman or its fuzzy orange headphones. A lawyer and an activist, <pname>Roman</pname> is a man who's frozen in the past, the personification of a guilty conscience for a more corporate, less moral world. He's also the star of <pname>Dan Gilroy</pname>'s new drama, which tries to reckon with how the American justice system has failed the idealism of generations gone by. Except, that is, when the film decides to be about something else entirely. One element is consistent throughout <pname>Roman J. Israel</pname>, Esq.—the enigmatic lead, played with typical dedication and forcefulness by <pname>Denzel Washington</pname>. But even though he's fully committed to the role, this movie is anything but, aimlessly weaving between story ideas like a distracted driver. <pname>Roman</pname>'s journey goes in strange directions: He steals a duffel bag filled with money; he locks horns with corporate attorneys; he tries to launch a lawsuit against the pillars of the American court system; he even falls in love. There's at least a third of <pname>Roman J. Israel</pname>, Esq. that I loved, and another third I had no patience for whatsoever. Ultimately, it's a small-scale work that nonetheless falls victim to its dizzying ambition. <pname>Roman J. Israel</pname>, Esq. seems all the more odd given that its writer and director is <pname>Gilroy</pname>, who made 2014's Nightcrawler, a propulsive and focused thriller starring <pname>Jake Gyllenhaal</pname> as a photographer caught up in the dark world of “if it bleeds, it leads” local news.
