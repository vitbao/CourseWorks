 Colorado Sens. <pname>Cory Gardner</pname>    (R) and <pname>Michael Bennet</pname>    (D) are pitching a bipartisan immigration compromise that includes a path to citizenship and money for President <pname>Trump</pname>   's border wall. The two senators filed an amendment on Wednesday as senators try to break a stalemate that is slowing the Senate's immigration debate.  The plan would provide a pathway to citizenship for "Dreamers" — undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children. It would also appropriate $25 billion in border security funding, including money for the U.S.-Mexico border wall.  "This legislation addresses [the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program] and border security, and we are urging members on both sides of the aisle that want a solution to support our bipartisan approach to addressing our flawed immigration system," <pname>Gardner</pname> said in a statement.  <pname>Bennet</pname> added that the proposal is "the result of each side accepting some things they don't fully agree with." The amendment would also boost the number of immigration judges and includes voluntary E-Verify, a program used by employers to check an individual's immigration status.  The Department of Homeland Security slammed the proposal almost immediately, calling it the "<pname>Schumer</pname> bill." “<pname>Gardner</pname>-<pname>Bennett</pname> bill, AKA the <pname>Schumer</pname> bill, violates the framework, would legalize unlimited numbers through chain migration, and leaves deadly loopholes intact," said <pname>Katie Waldman</pname>, a DHS spokeswoman.  The plan is the latest bipartisan measure to come forward as Republican leaders look to wrap up the Senate's debate this week.  Members of a bipartisan group led by Sen. <pname>Susan Collins</pname>    (R-Maine) are also expected to unveil their agreement on Wednesday.
