   In <pname>Robert Schenkkan</pname>'s “The Great Society,” <pname>Lyndon B. Johnson</pname> wins the 1964 election but loses his soul and goes to hell. American cities burn, and Vietnam drags him under by the lapels of his rumpled gray suit; in <pname>Kyle Donnelly</pname>'s enveloping production at Arena Stage, the flames actually lick at LBJ from below. “The Great Society” is <pname>Schenkkan</pname>'s sequel to “All the Way,” the Tony-winning drama that showed <pname>Johnson</pname> in full wheeler-dealer mode as he steered the Civil Rights Act to passage. <pname>Schenkkan</pname> is certainly interested in the legislative process, and the audience watched LBJ's hardball negotiations with a double consciousness during Thursday night's opening as the 2018 federal government shut down yet again. But <pname>Schenkkan</pname> is primarily smitten with <pname>Johnson</pname>'s big ideas and blunt tactics, and the show is driven by <pname>Jack Willis</pname>'s performance — a growling, full-throttle turn with the energy of a Mack truck roaring downhill. <pname>Willis</pname> has inhabited this role since “All the Way” premiered at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2012, and he's a solid fit. His bluster has power, the profane wit is tart, and the conscience that plagues LBJ rings absolutely true. Equally persuasive is the vindictiveness that finds <pname>Johnson</pname> turning increasingly to J. Edgar Hoover (a splendidly cast <pname>Richmond Hoxie</pname>, looking like a sour bloodhound). <pname>Schenkkan</pname>'s LBJ doesn't really have partners: Everyone's a chess piece, and scenes are engineered to show <pname>Johnson</pname> persuading or shoving them into place. A handshake is almost certainly a strong-arm in disguise. “The Great Society” is a starry parade of 1960s figures zipping through the Oval Office at an almost zany pace — <pname>Robert McNamara</pname> with updates from Vietnam, <pname>Martin Luther King Jr.</pname> talking strategy about Selma, <pname>George Wallace</pname> holding his ground as the recalcitrant Alabama governor, <pname>Robert F. Kennedy</pname> and <pname>Johnson</pname> rubbing each other the wrong way. That's a partial list, and Donnelly's bewigged, drab-suited cast (costumed by <pname>Nan Cibula-Jenkins</pname>) does a credible job looking and sounding the parts. A lot of the time, these figures simply deliver bulk information as <pname>Schenkkan</pname> keeps his narrative hustling through the entirety of <pname>Johnson</pname>'s term. But whenever the actors have time and space to make an impression, they take full advantage.   The show gains epic scale via the presidential seal on the floor of <pname>Kate Edmunds</pname>'s set, through lights by <pname>Nancy Schertler</pname> that sometimes shoot up through the floor and most notably from <pname>Aaron Rhyne</pname>'s projections on the outer walls of the in-the-round Fichandler space. (The bulk of the cast and design team is back from Donnelly's 2016 “All the Way.”) Tallies of the body count in Vietnam, protest footage and <pname>Walter Cronkite</pname>'s game-changing “stalemate” verdict on the war are among the images bringing history to life. <pname>Schenkkan</pname>'s script can make you shift and squirm when it resorts to shorthand — the too-comic manhandling of the American Medical Association, for instance, and trotting out <pname>Richard M. Nixon</pname> to kick around at the end. Like <pname>Margaret Thatcher</pname> in <pname>Moira Buffini</pname>'s dashing “Handbagged,” currently at Round House Theatre, <pname>Nixon</pname> declares his aim to make his country great again. It's worth noting that audiences are now wearily groaning at these lines. The fascinating thing is that <pname>Schenkkan</pname>'s portrait of an LBJ who increasingly compromised and lied evokes not only the Washington of the Pentagon Papers, but also Watergate, a thought that flickers even before <pname>Nixon</pname> shows up. It's in <pname>Willis</pname>'s performance: He is magnificent with this character's high and low style. He spins down-home anecdotes about snakes and bulls just right, and there's a steely edge and assured cadence to <pname>Willis</pname>'s voice that makes the stage all his. It's a performance with flash, but also the weight of tragedy.  You may not always believe in the satellite characters <pname>Schenkkan</pname> writes, but you buy this LBJ as he tries mightily to lift the country up exactly as he drags it into one of its blackest depths.
