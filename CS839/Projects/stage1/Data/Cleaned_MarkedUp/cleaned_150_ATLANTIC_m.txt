 Over the next month, The Atlantic's “And, Scene” series will delve into some of the most interesting films of the year by examining a single, noteworthy moment and unpacking what it says about 2017. Next up is <pname>James Franco</pname>'s The Disaster Artist. (Read our previous entries here.) There's nothing Hollywood loves more than a tale of suffering in the name of creation. Making great art can be a magical and infuriating endeavor, one that often requires sacrifice. Works that go behind the scenes of the cinematic process—like <pname>Francois Truffaut</pname>'s Day for Night and <pname>Tim Burton</pname>'s <pname>Ed Wood</pname>—tend to home in on the absurdity of such efforts, portraying directors at the center of manic three-ring circuses that couldn't possibly result in a meaningful film. The set of <pname>Tommy Wiseau</pname>'s 2003 movie The Room, dramatized this year in <pname>James Franco</pname>'s The Disaster Artist, was such a circus. But it was one that, against the odds, actually led to the creation of something special.
