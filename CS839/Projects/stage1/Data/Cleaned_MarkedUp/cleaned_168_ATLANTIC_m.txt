 The Golden Globe nominations were announced Monday morning, kicking off what looks to be a genuinely chaotic Oscar season with no discernible frontrunner for Best Picture. Several potential contenders featured prominently, including <pname>Steven Spielberg</pname>'s The Post, <pname>Martin McDonagh</pname>'s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, <pname>Guillermo del Toro</pname>'s The Shape of Water, <pname>Christopher Nolan</pname>'s Dunkirk, and <pname>Greta Gerwig</pname>'s <pname>Lady Bird</pname>. There was also a surprising slew of nominations for <pname>Ridley Scott</pname>'s upcoming drama All the Money in the World, which has been in the news largely because it went through drastic reshoots to replace <pname>Kevin Spacey</pname> with <pname>Christopher Plummer</pname> after the former was accused of sexual assault by multiple men. The Globes' film nominations have significant bearing on the Oscar race despite the comparative anonymity of the 90-member Hollywood Foreign Press Association (who vote on the awards).
