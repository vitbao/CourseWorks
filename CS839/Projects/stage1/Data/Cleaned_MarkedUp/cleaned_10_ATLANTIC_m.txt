 The late, great director <pname>Abbas Kiarostami</pname> was never afraid of lulling his audience into sleepy tranquility. “I absolutely don't like the films in which the filmmakers take their viewers hostage and provoke them,” he famously said in an interview. “I prefer the films that put their audience to sleep in the theater … Some films have made me doze off in the theater, but the same films have made me stay up at night, wake up thinking about them in the morning, and keep on thinking about them for weeks. Those are the kind of films I like.” In his nearly 50-year career working in and outside his native Iran, <pname>Kiarostami</pname> made movies that could be easily dismissed as “boring.” They were also meditative, hypnotic, challenging, and often arrestingly real, blurring the lines between fact and fiction in ways that asked audiences to think about the purpose of the cinematic medium. At the age of 76, <pname>Kiarostami</pname> was still directing innovative films and showing no sign of slowing down when he died of gastrointestinal cancer in 2016. That means his final project, 24 Frames, comes across as more elegiac than intended. But even by <pname>Kiarostami</pname>'s standards, this is a daringly, charmingly tedious piece of cinema, one pushing at the boundaries of what you could even call a “movie.” The first shot of 24 Frames is of an instantly recognizable work of art—<pname>Pieter Bruegel</pname> the Elder's 1565 painting The Hunters in the Snow. After a few seconds, the static shot comes to life: Smoke starts billowing from one of the chimneys, then another. Snow begins to fall. Birds start to circle overhead. A dog pops into the frame and starts sniffing around, eventually relieving himself against a tree. After about four and a half minutes, we're finished and onto “Frame Two.” Just what is going on? In each of 24 Frames' shots, a motionless picture comes alive, functioning like an artful screensaver. Aside from the first entry, the frames are inspired by photographs that <pname>Kiarostami</pname> himself took and then embellished upon, adding sound, movement (often animals wandering around), and weather, creating a miniature environment from a perfectly composed still image. Each one's four-and-a-half-minute running time is long enough to encourage the viewer to pick specific details out of the picture, or to simply let it wash over them.
