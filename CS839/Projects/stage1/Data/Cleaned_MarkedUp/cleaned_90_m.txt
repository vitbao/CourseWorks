   Has <pname>Danai Gurira</pname>, who plays the fierce warrior <pname>Michonne</pname> on the zombie hit “The Walking Dead,” really written a gentle family farce? And is Woolly Mammoth, long branded for edgy theatrical disruptions, offering a feel-good comedy? Yes and yes. <pname>Gurira</pname>'s “Familiar” is funny and warmhearted while remaining true to the serious turf she claimed in her earlier plays “Eclipsed,” “The Convert” and “In the Continuum.” <pname>Gurira</pname> is interested in African stories, and “Familiar” sticks close to her roots as the Iowa-born daughter of Zimbabweans. Some of the dialogue on race and cultural friction was so on point that during Friday night's opening, the hippest pockets of the audience snapped their fingers in approval. Minnesota is the setting, and the comfortable two-story home designed by <pname>Paige Hathaway</pname> looks like the sort of staid suburban milieu Woolly likes to blow up or burn down. But “Familiar” isn't like that. It skates merrily on one of the oldest plots in the world, an impending marriage that often hilariously bends the academic Zimbabwean American family out of shape. You'd think the issue would be <pname>Chris</pname>, the Christian white man whom the impeccably put-together 34-year-old lawyer <pname>Tendi</pname> (also Christian) wants to marry — <pname>Tendi</pname>'s mother, Marvelous, makes insulting remarks about what she calls “happy-clappy” churches. But faith and race are nothing compared with the tension that arises when <pname>Tendi</pname>'s aunt <pname>Anne</pname> arrives from Zimbabwe. <pname>Tendi</pname> and <pname>Chris</pname> want a quickie version of a traditional Zimbabwean wedding ceremony before everyone dashes off to the rehearsal dinner. Not so fast, <pname>Anne</pname> says, asserting her privilege as an elder and as the keeper of conventions.   For the first act's 75 minutes, <pname>Gurira</pname> scripts this like a vintage farce unfolding in real time. Family members come and go and squabble at top volume, and director <pname>Adam Immerwahr</pname>, artistic director of Theater J, smoothly navigates the flow as the family cheers a U.S. football team yet disagrees on whether <pname>Tendi</pname> and her younger sister <pname>Nyasha</pname> should have been taught the Zimbabwean language Shona. (They weren't.) The strength of the show is the radiant cast that pulls the pin on explosive laughs and leaves emotional room for the long, serious twist at the end. Inga Ballard's Marvelous is an imposing maternal force, clearly dominant in the house she runs with husband <pname>Donald</pname> (a strategically quiet Kim Sullivan). Sharina Martin's <pname>Tendi</pname>, in tall boots and a stylish skirt, comes across as fully American, especially as she tries to hurry <pname>Cheryl Lynn Bruce</pname>'s ambling <pname>Anne</pname>. <pname>Bruce</pname> anchors the funniest stretches of the play. <pname>Tendi</pname> has asked for a taste of Zimbabwe, but <pname>Bruce</pname>'s indomitable <pname>Anne</pname> brings a full banquet. As <pname>Chris</pname> and his gung-ho brother Brad, Drew Kopas and Andy Truschinski are amusing supplicants obeying <pname>Anne</pname>'s commands. The ensemble is rounded out by <pname>Twinkle Burke</pname> as the well-dressed but unhappy aunt <pname>Margaret</pname> and <pname>Shannon Dorsey</pname> as <pname>Tendi</pname>'s artsy sister <pname>Nyasha</pname>, who is as caught between cultures as anyone. The play is one of the standouts of Washington's current Women's Voices Theater Festival, even though it slows notably in the second act as <pname>Gurira</pname> unwinds a long-hidden secret and lets everyone have their say. The comic structure is not ingenious, but the spirit is so buoyant — and <pname>Gurira</pname>'s feeling for her people is so deep — that “Familiar” earns a little indulgence.
