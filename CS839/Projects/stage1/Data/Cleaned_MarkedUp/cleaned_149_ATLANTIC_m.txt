 Over the last month, The Atlantic delved into some of the most interesting films of 2017 by examining a single, noteworthy moment in each. Today: <pname>Steven Spielberg</pname>'s The Post. This will be the year's final installment of the “And, Scene” series, which can be found in its entirety here. The topicality of The Post is hard to miss, even if it's a period drama set in 1971. The movie's heroes are the news media, specifically a bunch of largely unsung reporters at The Washington Post (one of three competing daily newspapers in the city at the time ). The chief villain is the White House, specifically President <pname>Richard Nixon</pname>, played by the man himself (through his tape archives). The Post is trying, like The New York Times, to publish information from the Pentagon Papers, a damning internal study of U.S. involvement in the ongoing Vietnam War. <pname>Nixon</pname>, citing national security, is trying to block the outlets from doing so by any means necessary.
