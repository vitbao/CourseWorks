 <pname>Errol Morris</pname>'s Wormwood, which arrived on Netflix and in some movie theaters Friday, is a mind-boggling story involving LSD-spiked Cointreau, allegations of biological warfare against the U.S. government, Project MKUltra, mind control orchestrated by an allergist and a magician, and a son's obsessive quest to find out why his father plummeted to his death from a 13th-floor Manhattan hotel room. So why is it frequently so stultifying and so claustrophobic? How can such a riveting real-life tale of CIA malfeasance be so turgid in execution, to the point where the camera spends 90-plus seconds in one episode simply watching an actor in military uniform mix a drink? Wormwood has been widely heralded as groundbreaking work from the visionary documentarian behind The Thin Blue Line and the Interrotron interview method. Released as a six-part series on Netflix, and as a 240-minute long film in theaters, it combines interviews and archival footage with staged dramatic reenactment of events before and after the 1953 death of <pname>Frank Olson</pname>—a military scientist whose supposed “suicide” was complicated when the <pname>Rockefeller</pname> Report of 1975 revealed that he'd been secretly dosed with LSD. <pname>Morris</pname> has gathered an estimable cast of actors to play real-life characters, including <pname>Peter Sarsgaard</pname> as <pname>Frank</pname> and <pname>Molly Parker</pname> as his wife (Westworld's <pname>Jimmi Simpson</pname> has what amounts to a baffling cameo as a sinister man with no name and no dialogue). The director renders these scenes in gorgeous period detail that evokes the feel of a <pname>Todd Haynes</pname> movie. But all too often they slow the series down rather than add actual grist to the question of what <pname>Frank</pname> knew that might have gotten him killed. It's a true-crime documentary with a terminal case of Netflix bloat; an investigation into a heavily reported subject that ultimately yields no new information. The biggest asset <pname>Morris</pname> has is <pname>Eric Olson</pname>, <pname>Frank</pname>'s son, who's spent the better part of his life trying to uncover the facts about his father's death 64 years ago. <pname>Olson</pname> becomes the show's de facto narrator, unspooling detail after detail in his absorbing, mellifluous voice. His heavy presence onscreen further complicates Wormwood's line-treading between a journalistic endeavor and a polemical one, a balance that <pname>Morris</pname> pioneered in The Thin Blue Line, which used similar staged reenactments of witness statements to weigh the potential innocence of a convicted killer. There's less to litigate in Wormwood about <pname>Morris</pname>'s technique, simply because so many of the theories about <pname>Olson</pname>'s death—and the CIA's involvement in it—have already been reported, making formerly shocking theories easier to digest. In 1953, as <pname>Eric Olson</pname> explains, and as <pname>Morris</pname> re-creates, <pname>Frank Olson</pname> was an army scientist working at Fort Detrick in Maryland, where the U.S. biological weapons program was based. Wormwood painstakingly reenacts the nine days leading up to <pname>Olson</pname>'s death at the Statler Hotel in New York, starting with Day One, when he was unwittingly given LSD at a routine summit with CIA agents and interrogated. <pname>Morris</pname> conveys <pname>Frank</pname>'s altered state with unsettling artistry, capturing how a moose head mounted on the wall appears to exhale, and how voices in the room slur and stretch in nightmarish fashion.
