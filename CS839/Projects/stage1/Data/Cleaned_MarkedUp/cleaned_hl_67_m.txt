  Folks, it's now December. Can you believe it? I know I can't. We've reached the final month of 2017 already. Absolutely crazy how the time flew by, right? Well, with this end of the year comes the end of new releases, but Hollywood tends to save the best for last. As such, this rundown is as strong as it has ever been. From Academy Award contenders to blockbusters in the making, it's all here. Oscar will almost certainly take notice when it comes to most of these, so you should as well. Much like last month, even the honorable mentions are superb, so don't sleep on ones that didn't make my ten. Now though, I present the cream of the movie crop…  3. The Post – Another currently somewhat embargoed title, look for a piece on it in a few days, right around the same time as Phantom Thread. I can share this social media response I had to it, which went as follows: “<pname>Steven Spielberg</pname> targets <pname>Donald Trump</pname> with his version of Spotlight. Very much in the Bridge of Spies wheelhouse, it has a really strong <pname>Tom Hanks</pname> turn and performance by <pname>Meryl Streep</pname> that gets better as it goes along. By the end, she's doing something really great. Look for Oscar to nominate it here and there, though I'm skeptical about any wins.”  2. I, <pname>Tonya</pname> – One of the year's very best movies, this biopic of <pname>Tonya Harding</pname> is a real marvel. <pname>Margot Robbie</pname> deserves Best Actress buzz, with the same being said for <pname>Allison Janney</pname> especially in Best Supporting Actress. I'll have more on it next week, but just know, it's among the very best films of 2017…  1. The Disaster Artist – My favorite film of the year so far. I've raved about what <pname>James Franco</pname> captured here in his love letter to moviemaking, <pname>Tommy Wiseau</pname>, The Room, and dreamers everywhere. It's truly quite a special work. It's begun it s theatrical run to, so you have no excuses. Race out and see it. You can thank me later…  Be sure to check out these various films all throughout the month of December!
