  It was only a matter of time. Perhaps the biggest X factor all season long has been what to make of The Post, <pname>Steven Spielberg</pname>'s latest film. Centered on the epic fight that The Washington Post had with the United States government over the right to publish the infamous Pentagon Papers, this is Academy catnip. Until now though, it had been completely unseen. We were just going by the fact that <pname>Spielberg</pname> working with <pname>Tom Hanks</pname> and <pname>Meryl Streep</pname>, plus the subject matter, makes it a force to reckon with. Now, a Trailer has dropped, just a few hours ago. You'll be able to see it shortly, but first…a tiny bit of discussion is in order.  The film is described by 20th Century Fox like this: “<pname>Steven Spielberg</pname> directs <pname>Meryl Streep</pname> and <pname>Tom Hanks</pname> in The Post, a thrilling drama about the unlikely partnership between The Washington Post's <pname>Katharine Graham</pname> (<pname>Streep</pname>), the first female publisher of a major American newspaper, and editor <pname>Ben Bradlee</pname> (<pname>Hanks</pname>), as they race to catch up with The New York Times to expose a massive cover-up of government secrets that spanned three decades and four U.S. Presidents. The two must overcome their differences as they risk their careers – and their very freedom – to help bring long-buried truths to light.   The Post marks the first time <pname>Meryl Streep</pname>, <pname>Tom Hanks</pname> and <pname>Steven Spielberg</pname> have collaborated on a project. In addition to directing, <pname>Spielberg</pname> produces along with <pname>Amy Pascal</pname> and <pname>Kristie Macosko Krieger</pname>. The script was written by <pname>Liz Hannah</pname> and <pname>Josh Singer</pname>.  <pname>Janusz Kaminski</pname> and <pname>John Williams</pname> handle cinematography and the score, respectively.  Stay tuned for lots more to come on The Post between now and the end of the year!
