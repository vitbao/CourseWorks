 Neither side of the immigration debate is happy as the Senate enters its third formal day of debate on a replacement for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Immigration hawks are angry that the Republicans' starting volley in the Senate debate reallocates visas from the diversity lottery and family unification programs, rather than cutting legal immigration. “There is a sense of frustration from a lot of people who supported President <pname>Trump</pname>    from the beginning of his campaign, and we're very concerned about what we're seeing in terms of immigration,” said <pname>Jenny Beth Martin</pname>, chairwoman of the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund. Hard-liners within the Senate say that the GOP proposal, based on the White House framework, is the furthest that Republicans are willing to compromise. “The president's framework bill is not an opening bid for negotiations. It's a best and final offer,” Sen. <pname>Tom Cotton</pname>    (R-Ark.) said Tuesday on Fox News.But progressives who see the wide-ranging bill as a non-starter are starting to grow impatient that their own, narrower proposal — restoring DACA-style protections for immigrants brought to the county illegally as children in exchange for border-security measures — isn't getting a fair shake. “Three amendments are potentially in the mix for consideration on Democratic side — all three are bipartisan, instructive on how willing Democrats are to try to find a solution,” said <pname>Marshall Fitz</pname>, managing director for immigration at the Emerson Collective, a progressive policy organization. “None of the Republican amendments have the faintest veneer of bipartisanship,” he added. Conservatives want the House to set the tone by passing Rep. <pname>Bob Goodlatte</pname>   's (R-Va.) hard-line immigration bill, then use the legislation to hammer Democratic senators up for reelection in states won by <pname>Trump</pname>. Progressives want to take advantage of the Senate amendment process opened up by Majority Leader <pname>Mitch McConnell</pname>    (R-Ky.) to pass a bipartisan agreement that pairs relief for “Dreamers” with narrow border security provisions, putting pressure on Speaker <pname>Paul Ryan</pname>    (R-Wis.) and <pname>Trump</pname> to accept the Senate version. But any bill that reaches the House floor will need support from at least half the House Republicans. It's unlikely that any bill that could garner 60 votes in the Senate could make the House floor. The left is blaming <pname>Ryan</pname> for the impasse, saying he's too beholden to his party's conservative wing. “This could be done in 48 hours. The problem is <pname>Paul Ryan</pname> is an awful Speaker,” said Rep. <pname>Ruben Gallego</pname>    (D-Ariz.).
