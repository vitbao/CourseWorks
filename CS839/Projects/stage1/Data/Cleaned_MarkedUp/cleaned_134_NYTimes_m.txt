  Film lovers have long admired <pname>Isabelle Huppert</pname> as a fully committed performer who almost exclusively takes on challenging roles in challenging films. But a filmography of over 100 pictures is bound, if only by laws of statistics, to contain at least a little cinematic vin ordinaire. “Souvenir,” a slight romantic drama directed by Bavo Defurne and starring Ms. <pname>Huppert</pname>, is absolutely that. A preview of the film. The movie begins with images of bubbles in liquid, accompanied by a light, pleasant pop instrumental. We're meant to think it's a close-up of a glass of Champagne, but it's just an antacid tablet dissolving in water, introducing viewers to the quiet life of <pname>Liliane</pname>, played by Ms. <pname>Huppert</pname>. She has an unglamorous job in the garnish department of a pâté factory, reads the feminist author <pname>Marilyn French</pname> on the bus ride home and watches quiz shows in her passable but plain apartment. But she has a past, as a young man who becomes a colleague discovers. Years before, under the name <pname>Laura</pname>, she sang for France in a Eurovision song contest. A request from the colleague, <pname>Jean</pname> (<pname>Kévin Azaïs</pname>), to sing at a celebration for his father's cycling club, leads to both romance and a return to the stage. (And Ms. <pname>Huppert</pname> can sing, albeit in a narrow, understated range that's more reminiscent of <pname>Astrud Gilberto</pname>'s “The Girl From Ipanema” than the ABBA-evoking chanteuse her character is reputed to have been.) Her comeback yields, yes, a life of Champagne instead of antacid. The story is as predictable as they come, played out at such a low emotional temperature as to be practically ignorable. Which wouldn't necessarily be a problem if it offered something else worth paying attention to. Something else besides the endlessly watchable lead actress, that is.
