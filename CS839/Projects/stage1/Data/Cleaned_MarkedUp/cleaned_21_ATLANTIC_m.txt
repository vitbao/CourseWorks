 When All the Money in the World was fast-tracked into reshoots to replace scenes featuring <pname>Kevin Spacey</pname> (who has been accused of sexual assault), <pname>Michelle Williams</pname> saw it as a powerful sign that Hollywood was changing. At the director <pname>Ridley Scott</pname>'s insistence, the studio was spending upwards of $10 million to recast <pname>Spacey</pname> with <pname>Christopher Plummer</pname> in the role of the oil tycoon <pname>J. Paul Getty</pname>. As the film's lead actress, <pname>Williams</pname> immediately signed off on the decision. “They could have my salary, they could have my holiday, whatever they wanted,” she said at the time. “Because I appreciated so much that they were making this massive effort.” To <pname>Williams</pname>, the reshoots were a statement, but to her co-star <pname>Mark Wahlberg</pname>, they were an opportunity. In the film, <pname>Wahlberg</pname> plays <pname>Getty</pname>'s close adviser <pname>Fletcher Chase</pname>, the man tasked with rescuing his kidnapped grandson, <pname>Paul Getty</pname> (<pname>Charlie Plummer</pname>). <pname>Williams</pname> plays <pname>Paul</pname>'s mother, <pname>Gail Harris</pname>. Both actors have a significant number of scenes with the <pname>J. Paul Getty</pname> character and were vital to the reshoots, but only <pname>Wahlberg</pname> received an additional fee—$1.5 million—to participate, after reportedly refusing to approve the casting of <pname>Plummer</pname> until he himself was paid. <pname>Wahlberg</pname>'s primary agent, <pname>Doug Lucterhand</pname> of William Morris Endeavor (WME), led the charge, and because filming had to happen rapidly ahead of a Christmas release date, the financiers had to pony up. Once the massive discrepancy in the two actors' salaries came to light last week (<pname>Williams</pname> received only an $80 per diem), public outcry forced <pname>Wahlberg</pname>'s hand, and he donated $1.5 million to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, founded to fight pay inequity and the harassment of women across different industries. WME contributed another $500,000. “Over the last few days my reshoot fee for All the Money in the World has become an important topic of conversation,” <pname>Wahlberg</pname> said in a statement. “I 100 percent support the fight for fair pay and I'm donating … in <pname>Michelle Williams</pname>'s name.” The controversy, and resulting donations, marked a messy end to the already complex industry saga of All the Money in the World, one that encompassed so many of the issues that have been churned up by the <pname>Harvey Weinstein</pname> scandal and the #MeToo campaign. The <pname>Spacey</pname> allegations created a crisis for the movie that the studio rushed to address; the way the film's other two stars responded to that crisis was telling.
