  For about as long as <pname>Duncan Jones</pname> has been making movies, he's been talking about trying to get Mute made. This weekend, at long last, <pname>Jones</pname> will see his passion project revealed to the public, as the film is about to stream on Netflix. There was an embargo in place until today, so I can now chime in and say this is <pname>Jones</pname> at his weirdest. That's a good thing too, as he's mixing the world he created with Moon, the aesthetics of Blade Runner, and a number of other influences into something you won't easily forget. <pname>Jones</pname> clearly loves science fiction, and it shows here. The film is a sci-fi mystery, taking place within the universe first explored in Moon. Here, Berlin is the setting. It's on the harder side to describe this one, but I'll let IMDb (with a slight tinker by yours truly) start things off: “Berlin. Forty years from today. A roiling city of immigrants, where East crashes against West in a science-fiction Casablanca. <pname>Leo Beiler</pname> (<pname>Alexander Skarsgard</pname>), a mute bartender has one reason and one reason only for living here, and she's disappeared. But when <pname>Leo</pname>'s search takes him deeper into the city's underbelly, an odd pair of American surgeons (<pname>Paul Rudd</pname> and <pname>Justin Theroux</pname>) seem to be the only recurring clue, and <pname>Leo</pname> can't tell if they can help, or who he should fear most.” That's a solid start to a very odd movie. <pname>Jones</pname> directs and co-writes here with <pname>Michael Robert Johnson</pname>. As for the cast, besides <pname>Rudd</pname>, <pname>Skarsgard</pname>, and <pname>Theroux</pname>, we have the likes of <pname>Noel Clarke</pname>, <pname>Dominic Monaghan</pname>, <pname>Seyneb Saleh</pname>, and perhaps even a cameo from…<pname>Sam Rockwell</pname>. <pname>Gary Shaw</pname> handles the cinematography, while <pname>Clint Mansell</pname> contributes yet another top notch score. Netflix has this movie, and while that's a good way to get it out into the world, it's a shame that people won't be seeing this one on the big screen. At the same time, it makes sense why studios weren't lining up to finance <pname>Jones</pname>' vision. This is a dark and sometimes disturbing film, though at others, it's oddly humorous. It 100% feels like a passion project, the sort of thing that was written when a filmmaker was younger and angrier. It never comes to the heights of Moon, but it's on par with Source Code. <pname>Skarsgard</pname> is very effective in his silent role, while <pname>Rudd</pname> is interesting to watch play against type. Again, it won't be for everyone, but it's something strangely compelling to watch.
