   It is League One versus Premier League in the FA Cup this weekend - and will there be any surprises?' Rochdale v Tottenham (16:00 GMT, Sunday) and Wigan v Man City (19:55 GMT, Monday) are the two FA Cup fifth-round ties live on the BBC. <pname>Lawro</pname> is pitting his wits against a different guest for each round of this season's FA Cup and his opponent this time is YouTube star <pname>Tekkerz Kid</pname>. <pname>Tekkerz Kid</pname> predicts big FA Cup upsets as he takes on <pname>Lawro</pname>  <pname>Tekkerz Kid</pname> - real name <pname>Lorenzo Greer</pname> - is an eight-year-old footballer from Birmingham whose videos include skills tutorials and kit reviews, and whose channel has more than 900,000 subscribers.He's supporting the BBC online safety initiative Own It which is teaching kids how to take control or their lives online.<pname>Lawro</pname> is not expecting any surprises in the games on the BBC but is expecting at least one big shock over the weekend.Swansea boss <pname>Carlos Carvalhal</pname> goes back to his former side Sheffield Wednesday and <pname>Lawro</pname> is expecting an unhappy reunion for the Portuguese coach."I just have a feeling, quite often when a manager who has just left goes back, everyone wants to prove a point," says <pname>Lawro</pname>."I think this might be the upset of the round."How to follow the FA Cup fifth round on BBC SportFA Cup fourth-round predictions.  <pname>Lawro</pname>'s prediction: 1-2<pname>Tekkerz Kid</pname>'s prediction: In the last round Huddersfield ended up winning comfortably at St Andrew's against Birmingham, and Manchester United did the same at Yeovil. I think there will be goals in this game. I don't think Manchester United can afford to have another loss so I think they will put out a strong team and win. I think <pname>Jesse Lingard</pname> will score one, <pname>Lukaku</pname> will score one and Alexis Sanchez will score two but I have no doubt Huddersfield will score. 2-4.SUNDAYRochdale v Tottenham (16:00 GMT)Rochdale got through to the fifth round by drawing at Millwall and then beating them at home on what looked like a beach. It is just something Tottenham will have to deal with. No doubt <pname>Mauricio Pochettino</pname> will change his team around after they played in the Champions League earlier this week.Keith Hill has been at Rochdale for a long, long time. They are not doing particularly well in the league but this will be a massive day for them. However, I think Tottenham, whatever team they select, will have too much for them.<pname>Lawro</pname>'s prediction: 0-2League One (23rd)vPremier League (Fifth)Who did they beat?4R: Millwall (C)4R: Newport County (L2)3R: Doncaster (L1)3R: AFC Wimbledon (L1)2R: Slough (NL)1R: Bromley (NL)<pname>Tekkerz Kid</pname>'s prediction: It is a League One team versus a Premier League team and I definitely think Spurs will win, especially if <pname>Harry Kane</pname> is playing. If he is playing he will just keep scoring against them. I think he will get at least two goals.  Wigan have knocked out two Premier League teams out on the way to the fifth round but this is completely different gravy. Manchester City played on Tuesday, they will be well rested but they will probably leave a couple of first-team players out just for insurance.I'm expecting a great atmosphere and a full house at Wigan, which is good for them, but you would argue both sides have bigger fish to fry. Wigan will want to get out of League One and promoted as champions.
