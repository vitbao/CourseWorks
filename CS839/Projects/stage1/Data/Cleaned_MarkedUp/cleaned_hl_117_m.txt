  After being snubbed for his performance in The Social Network, <pname>Andrew Garfield</pname> took a detour from the awards season for a while. Part of that was his turn as <pname>Spider-Man</pname>, to be sure, though overall he just wasn't making Academy friendly fare. Then, last year found him in contention for a pair of prestige titles, with Hacksaw Ridge and Silence. The former got <pname>Garfield</pname> his first nomination, while the latter expanded his range. This week, Breathe opens and hopes to propel <pname>Garfield</pname> back into the Best Actor field. All of the ingredients are there, so it's definitely possible that we're entering a period of time where <pname>Garfield</pname> will consistently be in the Oscar hunt. The film is a biopic of <pname>Robin Cavendish</pname> (<pname>Garfield</pname>) and <pname>Diana Cavendish</pname> (<pname>Claire Foy</pname>), a couple that defied the odds in truly spectacular fashion. When <pname>Robin</pname> is diagnosed with polio and loses the use of his legs at the age of 28, he is initially given only a few short months to live. At that time, he's confined to a hospital bed and essentially left for dead. With the help of <pname>Diana</pname>'s twin brothers (both played by <pname>Tom Hollander</pname>) as well as the quirky yet groundbreaking ideas of inventor <pname>Teddy Hall</pname> (<pname>Hugh Bonneville</pname>), <pname>Robin</pname> is able to leave the hospital. Not only that, he and <pname>Diana</pname> lead a full life, including raising their young son, traveling the world, and devoting their lives to helping other polio patients in similar situations. <pname>Andy Serkis</pname> makes his directional debut here, with the script coming from <pname>William Nicholson</pname>.  Despite being an absolute sucker for dramas that make you cry (seriously, I sob at over a dozen movies a year), this one oddly left me stone faced. The emotions are there and <pname>Serkis</pname> executes them all well enough, but it just felt a little cold. I know that doesn't seem to make sense, but it was simply missing the special sauce that moved me. <pname>Foy</pname> is excellent, <pname>Garfield</pname> continues to build on his work last year (he's far better here, for my money), and <pname>Serkis</pname> proves he definitely can direct. Some are absolutely in love with this one. It just didn't turn out to be my cup of tea. Oscar wise, Breathe is as much a play for <pname>Foy</pname> as it is for <pname>Garfield</pname>. That being said, I'm sure a robust campaign will be launched. Look for categories like Best Picture, Best Director (for <pname>Serkis</pname>), Best Actor (for <pname>Garfield</pname>), Best Supporting Actress (for <pname>Foy</pname>, unless she ends up ultimately going Lead), Best Original Screenplay (for <pname>Nicholson</pname>), Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Score to get real pushes. <pname>Foy</pname> and <pname>Garfield</pname> are the main concerns though, along with Picture. <pname>Garfield</pname> in Actor definitely could happen, while <pname>Foy</pname> in Supporting Actor isn't out of the question as well. Stay tuned there to see how they do during the precursors.  Starting on Friday, fans of tearjerkers could be in for a real good cry when Breathe opens. It didn't create waterworks for me, but your mileage may vary. Furthermore, those of you who love <pname>Foy</pname> on The Crown or <pname>Garfield</pname> in general might be in for a treat. They are both at the top of their respective games in this one. Inspirational biopics are a dime a dozen during awards season, so something has to separate each one from the pack. In this case, it's the two main performances. If that appeals to you, this one should do so as well. Give it a shot, if soâ€¦ Be sure to check out Breathe, beginning its theatrical run this weekend!
