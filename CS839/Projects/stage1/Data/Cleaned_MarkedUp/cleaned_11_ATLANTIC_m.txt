 In 1980, when he was 34 years old, <pname>Donald Trump</pname> taped an interview with <pname>Rona Barrett</pname>, the gossip columnist and broadcaster. At that time, <pname>Trump</pname> had only recently started investing in Manhattan real estate, and the first Trump Tower in midtown was three years from completion. But he was already telling anyone who'd listen—including <pname>Barrett</pname>—that he was a billionaire. In the interview, which never aired, the pair discussed money, politics, and <pname>Trump</pname>'s ambition, including his personal conviction that anything you can dream, you can achieve. “If you lost your fortune today, what would you do?” <pname>Barrett</pname> asked. “Maybe I'd run for president,” <pname>Trump</pname> replies. “I don't know.” The exchange features in the final episode of Dirty Money, a fascinating and frequently enraging new documentary series on Netflix that tackles capitalism run amok—portraits of people and companies whose greed was so extreme and so untroubled by ethical boundaries that they engaged in truly historic acts of grift. The series explores how HSBC laundered money for drug cartels, how a race car driver was engaged in an illegal payday loan business that involved millions of Americans, and how Volkswagen cheated and lied to consumers globally about how dirty its diesel engines were. And then there's <pname>Trump</pname>: In an episode called “The Confidence Man,” Dirty Money traces the origins of the president's wealth, his lean years in the 1990s, and his more dubious business entanglements in Azerbaijan in the lead-up to his run for office. It's this final installment, directed by the Oscar-winning documentarian <pname>Fisher Stevens</pname> (The Cove), that will probably draw the most eyeballs, and to <pname>Stevens</pname>'s credit, he's drawn a thorough and engaging work from a subject that's been exhaustively reported on. But the series, executive produced by <pname>Alex Gibney</pname> (Going Clear: Scientology & the Prison of Belief; Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room), is distinguished by the way it crafts a larger message about unfettered capitalism out of all of its infuriating, logic-defying stories. The creation of capital, <pname>Gibney</pname> argues in “Hard Nox,” his investigation into Volkswagen, is based on financial abstractions about risk and reward. There's no space in the equation for moral considerations, only numbers. Dirty Money proves its thesis not just by exposing corporations, but also by rendering thoughtful, intimate portraits of individuals whose desire to accumulate wealth has transformed into a terminal kind of myopia. “Payday,” directed by <pname>Jesse Moss</pname>, is an astonishing hour and eight minutes spent unpacking <pname>Scott Tucker</pname>, the race car driver who earlier this month was sentenced to 16 years in prison for operating an illegal payday-lending operation that hid behind Native American tribes and their sovereignty. <pname>Moss</pname> gets so much access to <pname>Tucker</pname> and his family that the episode opens as <pname>Tucker</pname> is furiously working out in his home gym while his cars are being impounded by federal agents. His wife is disgusted by the idea that someone else might buy them. She would never, she tells the camera, want “to be part of the process of the destruction of somebody's life.”
