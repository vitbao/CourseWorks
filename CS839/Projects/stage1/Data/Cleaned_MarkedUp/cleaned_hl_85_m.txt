  Very few films are perfect. That's a rare beast in the cinematic world. So, I want to be perfectly clear when I say that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is perfect. It truly is. The movie stands tall among almost every single other 2017 release. As terrific as the Trailers have been, they in no way prepare you for the staggering heights of this work. Opening in theaters this week, it could very well become a strong hit for Fox Searchlight. Beyond that, the flick is undoubtedly going to be an Academy Award favorite when nominations are announced. That goes without saying at this point. Voters will go hard for this one.  This movie is a black comedy of sorts. It has been many month since <pname>Mildred Hayes</pname> (<pname>Frances McDormand</pname>) found out that her daughter was raped and murdered. The police, led by Chief <pname>Willoughby</pname> (<pname>Woody Harrelson</pname>) have no leads, and her frustration has mounted. In a fit of rage, she rents a trio of billboards on the outskirts of town, with messaged aimed at spurring action on the case. <pname>Willoughby</pname> attempts to reason with her, while racist and simply Officer <pname>Dixon</pname> (<pname>Sam Rockwell</pname>) goes with a blunter route. She won't budge though. Even with her son <pname>Robbie</pname> (<pname>Lucas Hedges</pname>) and ex husband <pname>Charlie</pname> (<pname>John Hawkes</pname>) on her case, she just wants someone to pay for what was done to her daughter. I won't say where this film goes, but every character ends up in a completely unexpected place. <pname>Martin McDonagh</pname> writes and directs. <pname>Carter Burwell</pname> is behind the score, while the cinematography is by <pname>Ben Davis</pname>.
