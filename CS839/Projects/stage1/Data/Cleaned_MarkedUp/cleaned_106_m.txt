   If art is a reflection of society, it<pname>Annalisa Dias</pname> can't be good that Washington's had three plays in the past year about a prisoner in an orange jumpsuit, chained to the floor, being interrogated by lawyers or reporters. The latest is <pname>Annalisa Dias</pname>'s “4,380 Nights,” mainly set in a Guantanamo Bay holding cell. Unlike <pname>Robert Schenkkan</pname>'s 90-minute Trumpian dystopia “Building the Wall” and <pname>Nicholas Wright</pname>'s 80-minute “A Human Being Died That Night,” though, “4,380 Nights” is a serpentine affair. It winds past two hours and stretches terrorism paranoia to include atrocities in 19th-century Algeria, and even back to Roman times. It's a lush historical buffet but a lot to digest, and Signature Theatre's entry into the current Women's Voices Theater Festival could use a disciplined dramaturgical hand. “4,380 Nights” also conjures <pname>Hanna Eady</pname> and <pname>Edward Mast</pname>'s “The Return,” a 75-minute two-character drama about an Israeli woman and an unjustly incarcerated Palestinian man. The man was played by <pname>Ahmad Kamal</pname>, who spends most of his time in chains as the apparently unjustly incarcerated figure in “4,380 Nights.” The compelling <pname>Kamal</pname> is more wry and bitter as fictional detainee <pname>Malik Essaid</pname> than he was in “The Return,” though <pname>Essaid</pname>'s interrogation by a liberal U.S. lawyer (Michael John Casey) working pro bono can be frustratingly slow. Even so, <pname>Dias</pname> is onto something: the ill-defined limbo of Guantanamo, where legal certitude goes to die, and the identity limbo of <pname>Essaid</pname>.    <pname>Ahmad Kamal</pname> and <pname>Lynette Rathnam</pname> in “4,380 Nights.” (C. Stanley)  His background is Algerian and French. His recent movements have tracked from Paris to London to Afghanistan and Pakistan. The thuggish U.S. soldier (<pname>Rex Daugherty</pname>, delivering straight menace) trying to beat information out of <pname>Essaid</pname> is only too eager to connect the dots. <pname>Dias</pname> channels some interesting procedural information into <pname>Essaid</pname>'s dialogue with the lawyer, but sheer frustration too often gets the upper hand. The story time-shifts to 19th-century Algeria, where <pname>Kamal</pname> plays a local working for the French who gets tangled in a war crime. <pname>Kathleen Akerley</pname>'s simple staging in front of a grim curtain of dangling metal chains gives the script a clean hearing, but the drama is too overwritten and under-compressed to land powerfully. The other big wrinkle in this four-character play is an unnamed woman who is a poetic storyteller in the style of “Arabian Nights”; <pname>Lynette Rathnam</pname> brings a dancer's quality to her yarn-spinning, but the script doesn't weave these strands into the revelatory historical pattern <pname>Dias</pname> is after.
