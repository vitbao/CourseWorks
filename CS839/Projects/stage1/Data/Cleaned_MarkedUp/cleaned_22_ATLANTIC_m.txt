 <pname>Edward Cullen</pname>. <pname>Chuck Bass</pname>. <pname>Lloyd Dobler</pname>. <pname>Spike</pname> from <pname>Buffy</pname> the Vampire Slayer. That guy from Love Actually with the sign. The lead singers of emo bands with their brooding lyrics. Many of the romantic heroes that made me swoon in my youth followed a pattern and, like a Magic Eye picture, only with a little distance did the shape of it pop out to me. All of these characters in some way crossed, or at least blurred, the lines of consent, aggressively pursuing women with little or no regard for their desires. But these characters' actions, and those of countless other leading men across the pop-culture landscape, were more likely to be portrayed as charming than scary. Romance often involves a bit of pursuit—someone has to make a move, after all. And there's certainly a spectrum of pursuit: Sometimes supposedly romantic gestures in pop culture veer toward the horrendous or illegal; sometimes they're just a bit creepy or overzealous. But revisiting some of these fictional love stories can leave one with the understanding that intrusive attention is proof of men's passion, and something women should welcome. In a number of cases, male characters who were acknowledged to have gone too far—by, for example, actually forcing themselves on women—were quickly forgiven, or their actions compartmentalized and forgotten. I grew up watching movies in which women found it flattering when their pursuers showed up uninvited to hold a boombox under their window, or broke into their bedrooms to watch them sleep, or confessed their feelings via posterboard while their love interest's husband sat in the next room. So I found it flattering, too. I sang along with The Killers' “Change Your Mind” (“If the answer is no, can I change your mind?”) and Fall Out Boy's “7 Minutes in Heaven” (“I keep telling myself I'm not the desperate type, but you've got me looking in through blinds”) without a second thought about what the lyrics implied. Allegations of sexual harassment have been pouring out of the entertainment industry, among others, in recent months. But while predatory male behavior has been condoned and covered up behind the scenes, it's also been glorified on screen and on the page and on the radio. As my colleague <pname>Lenika Cruz</pname> put it to me: “Rape culture, actually, is all around.” The narratives of a culture help to set its norms. Research has already found that romantic comedies can normalize stalking behavior. It's not difficult, then, to imagine that toxic love stories can also normalize coercion. That they can make people—women, especially—question when and whether their boundaries have really been violated, when they should be flattered and when they should be afraid.
