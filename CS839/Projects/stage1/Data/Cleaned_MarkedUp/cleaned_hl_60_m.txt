  The force is strong with this one. Very strong, in fact. <pname>Rian Johnson</pname> has managed a delicate balance with Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Not only has he crafted a more than worthy sequel, he's also differentiated himself with the most distinctive outing yet. This bodes very well for the next trilogy he's begun developing. This week, the film opens across the globe and looks to be a massive hit. It could very well be as big as Star Wars: The Force Awakens was. At the very least, it should easily be 2017's biggest movie. Luckily, it's also one of the year's very best.  This film, for those somehow not in the know about it, is the next installment in the main portion of the iconic Star Wars Saga. <pname>Johnson</pname> writes and directs this new episode. <pname>John Williams</pname> once again provides the score here, while <pname>JSteve Yedlin</pname> will handle the cinematography.  In some ways, this is the best Star Wars has to offer. <pname>Johnson</pname> crafts something different, full of surprises, yet also chock full of homages. Nearly a half dozen moments at the press screening I attended last night resulted in cheers and/or standing ovations. That's rare too, in case you were wondering. One other thing I will mention is that the movie is dedicated to <pname>Fisher</pname>, and how they phrase that over the end credits will put a lump in your throat. The less said about what happens, the better, but just know that it's great. Be sure to check out Star Wars: The Last Jedi, in theaters everywhere this weekend!
