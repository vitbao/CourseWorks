 Let’s say that “Annihilation,” currently in theaters, didn’t fill your quota for intelligent, horror-infused science fiction with a sizable debt to Andrei Tarkovsky. “They Remain,” directed, edited and scripted by Philip Gelatt, from a short story by Laird Barron, shows that it’s possible to a make an engrossing genre piece on limited resources. The movie’s essential ingredients are simply two good actors, a lab compound, surveillance cameras and an eerie forest that may be driving the characters mad. A preview of the film. An opening quotation from H.P. Lovecraft signals that explanations won’t be forthcoming. Keith (William Jackson Harper) and Jessica (Rebecca Henderson) have been sent by their company to a remote pocket of woodland on some sort of biological study, but the animals are acting strangely. The location was also the site of a massacre by a cult that sounds like a cross between the Peoples Temple and the Manson family. Inevitably, the surveillance cameras will malfunction, stories of troubled past teams will be shared and strange voices and hallucinations will enter the picture. (There are too many only-a-dream fakeouts.) “They Remain” is less interesting for its familiar ideas than its lo-fi craft. Mr. Gelatt uses negative space to emphasize Jessica and Keith’s isolation from each other and plays games with perspective, inviting speculation about Jessica’s offscreen actions. Productive ambiguity can tip into unrealized potential, and “They Remain” ultimately leans too heavily on vagueness as a crutch. But an unsatisfying ending isn’t the end of the world.
