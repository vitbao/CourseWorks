 Handsome cinematography and a highly competent supporting cast — including Michelle Monaghan, Nathan Lane and Alex Karpovsky — can’t save “The Vanishing of Sidney Hall,” a tortured mystery dripping with pretentiousness. Harboring enough trauma to fuel several seasons of “This Is Us,” the story (by the director, Shawn Christensen, and Jason Dolan) might have packed more heat had it unfolded in linear form. Instead, it flashes repeatedly in and out of three distinct timelines in which Sidney (played throughout by Logan Lerman) is first a precociously talented teenager, then a celebrated but imploding novelist married to his high school sweetheart (Elle Fanning) and last a hirsute hobo living off the grid. Between these periods lies a world of hurt that includes suicide, sexual abuse and probable brain damage, all of it barely teased until a walloping final reveal — a dump of distress that feels wholly unearned. Characters are sketched instead of developed, the looping structure blurring some (most egregiously, Blake Jenner’s critical role as a troubled jock and Margaret Qualley’s blink-and-you-miss-it turn as a melting-down mistress) and eliding others. A preview of the film. Only Kyle Chandler, who could inject authenticity into the most ludicrous character, escapes unscathed. Playing a mysterious stranger who’s doggedly investigating Sidney’s third-act disappearance, Mr. Chandler weaves a thread of stability around a disastrously fragmented plot. Yet his character’s devotion to Sidney’s redemption feels entirely undeserved. Introduced while smugly declaiming his masturbatory fantasies to his high school English class, Sidney is barely bearable. The movie tries to convince us it’s not his fault, but, really, we don’t care.
