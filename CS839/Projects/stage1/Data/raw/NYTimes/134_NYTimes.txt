 Film lovers have long admired Isabelle Huppert as a fully committed performer who almost exclusively takes on challenging roles in challenging films. But a filmography of over 100 pictures is bound, if only by laws of statistics, to contain at least a little cinematic vin ordinaire. “Souvenir,” a slight romantic drama directed by Bavo Defurne and starring Ms. Huppert, is absolutely that. A preview of the film. The movie begins with images of bubbles in liquid, accompanied by a light, pleasant pop instrumental. We’re meant to think it’s a close-up of a glass of Champagne, but it’s just an antacid tablet dissolving in water, introducing viewers to the quiet life of Liliane, played by Ms. Huppert. She has an unglamorous job in the garnish department of a pâté factory, reads the feminist author Marilyn French on the bus ride home and watches quiz shows in her passable but plain apartment. But she has a past, as a young man who becomes a colleague discovers. Years before, under the name Laura, she sang for France in a Eurovision song contest. A request from the colleague, Jean (Kévin Azaïs), to sing at a celebration for his father’s cycling club, leads to both romance and a return to the stage. (And Ms. Huppert can sing, albeit in a narrow, understated range that’s more reminiscent of Astrud Gilberto’s “The Girl From Ipanema” than the ABBA-evoking chanteuse her character is reputed to have been.) Her comeback yields, yes, a life of Champagne instead of antacid. The story is as predictable as they come, played out at such a low emotional temperature as to be practically ignorable. Which wouldn’t necessarily be a problem if it offered something else worth paying attention to. Something else besides the endlessly watchable lead actress, that is.
