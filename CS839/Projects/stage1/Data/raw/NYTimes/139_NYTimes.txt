 This documentary about the photojournalist Chris Hondros is also a tribute, directed by his longtime friend, Greg Campbell, himself a journalist. After some harrowing video footage in which Mr. Hondros finishes a phone call while crouching for cover around the corner from a fire fight, the movie cuts to an archival interview with Mr. Hondros, who died in Libya in 2011. Likable and articulate, the photographer responds to a question about war photographers being “the craziest” of journalists: “The problem with war photography is there’s absolutely no way to do it from a distance. You have to be close.” A preview of the film. In Iraq, Liberia, Libya and elsewhere, Mr. Hondros got very close, during conflicts in which old rules of engagement were eroding. The movie is at its best telling discrete stories of Mr. Hondros’s excursions. In Tal Afar, Iraq, in 2005, American soldiers opened fire on a car approaching a checkpoint and wound up orphaning two Iraqi children whose continued stories the film tells. Mr. Hondros’s pictures of the traumatized children are some of the most famed images from that war zone. The filmmakers visit Samar Hassan, the little girl featured in the Hondros photograph from Tal Afar, now a teenager. She is eloquent in her rage at those responsible for her parents’ death. The interview scene is impressive for that reason. But the movie has already claimed that Samar’s brother Rakan was targeted and killed because of the exposure he received in Western media. It made this viewer a little queasy, then, to see the filmmakers bring Samar into their lens. If the movie doesn’t go more than skin deep in interrogating questions about interventions both military and journalistic into the Middle East, it does succeed in opening up Mr. Hondros’s contradiction-filled world.
