Adam Rippon may be done skating at this year's Winter Olympics, but thankfully that doesn't mean we've seen the last of him.
In addition to winning a bronze medal in the team skating event, the 28-year-old figure skater has made headlines both as one of two openly gay U.S. male athletes competing in Pyeongchang and for speaking up to Vice President Mike Pence in support of LGBTQ rights. 
Oh, also for his sass — an element of his personality that will likely be on full display as he spends the rest of the Olympics working as an NBC correspondent.

That's right, NBC offered Rippon a gig, and according to USA Today Sports he accepted. That means we'll see his beauty on TV, digital streams, and social media. 

With everything going on in the media about me this Valentine’s Day I don’t want people to get distracted and forget how beautiful I am (on the outside)

Rippon's numerous fan, unsurprisingly, couldn't be happier about the news — or just generally more in love with the self-described icon.

This represents a change in plans for Rippon, who had previously told Good Morning America that his post-Olympics itinerary included something a little different to prime-time commentary. 
"I'm going to go to Target, and I'm going to get a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc Oyster Bay with the twist top," he proclaimed. "Yeah. Uh-huh. Immediately."
Thankfully for all of Rippon's fans out there, that Sauvignon Blanc will have to wait — at least until after the 2018 Winter Olympics come to a close.
