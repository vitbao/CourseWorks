Bill Gates, the man Dennis Feinstein once famously referred to as "like a super-nerd," is reportedly set to appear on TV's nerdiest sitcom: The Big Bang Theory.
The Microsoft founder-turned-billionaire philanthropist will play himself in a March episode of the series, EW reports. He pops up when he visits the pharmaceutical company where Penny works, and of course the guys want to meet him.

Gates has been mentioned on the show before, having once punched Sheldon for criticizing Windows Vista, but he's never appeared in person. The chances of Sheldon saying something dumb again — he suggested that Gates's focus on philanthrophy was the reason Vista had problems — seem extremely high.
The Big Bang Theory has hosted a number of geeky heroes over the years, including Stars Trek and Wars favorites LeVar Burton and Carrie Fisher, scientists Stephen Hawking and Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. So Gates is in good company.
It's not clear when the episode in question will air, but The Big Bang Theory returns to CBS on Thursday, March 1, at 8 p.m. ET.
