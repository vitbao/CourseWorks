What is it with islands turning into tropical cyclone magnets lately? First there was the hellish Atlantic hurricane season, when storms wiped out Domenica, Barbuda, Puerto Rico, St. John and other islands.Â 
Now the tiny Pacific Island nation of Tonga, which juts out into the South Pacific, southwest of American Samoa, was struck on Sunday night eastern time by the strongest storm of 2018 so far: Category 4 Cyclone Gita.Â

Tropical Cyclone Gita, packing sustained winds of 145 miles per hour, making it the equivalent of a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Scale, swept across the southernmost Tongalese islands on Sunday night and Monday eastern time.Â

TC Gita is ruthless. From indoors, Itâ€™s like a soundtrack to a horror movie out at sea. Tonga Met Service Office now deroofed ðŸ˜”. Now radar-less, in God we trust. Letâ€™s perservere #Tonga ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡´ #eyesonGod

The storm underwent a period of rapid intensification on Sunday as it moved to the west, on a collision course with the island. By the time it struck, it was a formidable storm that passed close to the islands of Tongatapu and 'Eua.Â

The eyewall of #CycloneGita hit most of Tonga as a Cat-4 of 125kts (JTWC). It seems that the eye calm (or calming) may have been felt in some areas. It's the strongest TC hit on land since #HurricaneMaria on Sep 20 in #PuertoRico, also at similar force. Expect severe damage news: pic.twitter.com/JyY5aaNvXH

It's likely that the island nation has sustained major damage. Tongatapu alone has about 75,000 people, and it appeared to enter the storm's eye wall, where the fiercest winds and heaviest rains are located.Â 
Tropical Cyclone Gita is forecast to move to the southwest during the next few days, potentially impacting Noumea, New Caledonia, and potentially bringing stormy weather to northern New Zealand by late in the week.Â 

Tropical Cyclone #Gita hit #Tonga today with the strength of a Category 4 hurricane, the #Himawari8 geostationary satellite captured the path of the storm over the past 24 hours. Learn more about our international satellite partners in orbit here: https://t.co/SMSgTCxp0U pic.twitter.com/oefCA1fzZR

No word yet on any reaction from the Tongalese Olympic team, which is currently competing in the winter olympics in South Korea.Â
