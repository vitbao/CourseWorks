In Star Wars: The Last Jedi, all those wailing porg squeals are just chickens processed through what amounts to an Alvin and the Chipmunks filter.
A new ABC News documentary covering the sound design in The Last Jedi takes an up-close look at the efforts of the foley crew. They're the reason that porgs, rolling droids like BB-8, or even something as simple as footsteps all sound like distinct, natural extensions of the images on screen.

There are several big spoilers in here, so don't hit "play" until you've seen The Last Jedi.

The documentary doesn't just look at sound effects. It's packaged around profiling the work of Matthew Wood, supervising sound editor on the film. From that perspective, the 30-minute special highlights how many of the biggest and most memorable moments hinge on sound
There's a whole section, for example, devoted to revealing how the Kylo/Rey Force-talk scenes arrived at their distinctive "speaking in a vacuum" sound. Another peels back the many audio layers behind a split-second moment with BB-8 and a drunken alien gambler during the Canto Bight scene.
Yes, the Holdo Maneuver is in there too. Obviously.
If you like Star Wars and you're interested in learning more about an often under-discussed but completely essential and wildly creative facet of filmmaking, this is a great watch.
It's also a good thing to check out if you need something to tide you over until you can see Star Wars: The Last Jedi again. The movie will be out for video on-demand services on March 13 and for Blu-ray and DVD on March 27.
