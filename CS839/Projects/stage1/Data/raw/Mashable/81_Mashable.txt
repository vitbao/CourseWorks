Excited for Black Panther? So are we. Which is why we're rolling out obsessive coverage with Black Panther Week. 
Although he didn't appear in Black Panther, renaissance man Donald Glover was still able to leave his mark on Marvel's latest superhero movie.
During an interview with Entertainment Tonight on Tuesday, Glover revealed that director Ryan Coogler asked Glover to take a look at the Black Panther script, which was the reasoning behind his  special thank you in the credits of the movie.

Glover, along with his brother Stephen, both had a little bit of time to read the script and help out where they could.
"We had a couple of hours to look over it, punch up some jokes and stuff like that," Glover told Entertainment Tonight. "It was already there anyway — they had already done a great job — so it was really cool just to get our fingerprints on there a little bit too."
In an interview with Collider from earlier this month, Coogler said the Glover brothers gave him some notes on a draft of the script right before the movie started to shoot, mentioning that they focused on parts where Shuri poked fun of her brother (a.k.a. T'Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther).
"Donald's one of the funniest people that I know so he had some interesting ideas and Stephen's crazy talented as well."
The Glovers are both currently working on the hit FX show Atlanta, where both work as writers. Donald Glover created and stars in Atlanta and has previously dabbled in more comedic roles in shows like Community and has performed stand-up comedy. Donald previously worked on the soundtrack for Coogler's previous film, Creed.
