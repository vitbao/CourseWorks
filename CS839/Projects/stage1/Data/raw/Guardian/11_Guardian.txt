Jacqui Gabb, professor of sociology and intimacy at the Open University, joins Alix Fox to discuss your responses to the last three editions of Close Encounters, our series of sex podcasts. We recommend you listen to the episodes before listening to this podcast.Alix and Jacqui discuss the personal stories you sent us after hearing our interviews with Michelle, Reuben, Omar and Jords. We learn how couples can accommodate very different sex drives into their relationship, we check-in with Jords (episode eight) several months down the line from his decision to stop dating, and we hear some of the novel ways our listeners have satiated their sexual desires alone.
