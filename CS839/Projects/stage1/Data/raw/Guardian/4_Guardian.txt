What were you hoping for?Someone to have a laugh and a flirt with.First impressions?He looked like the kind of guy who was in all the school sports teams.What did you talk about?The NHS, south London curry, outdoor swimming.Any awkward moments?He said he lived in Streatham and it “wasn’t great”, so I said I lived in Brixton (I live in Streatham).Good table manners?Yes, although we were confused about what the pebble on the table was for.Best thing about Ed?He chose the vegan menu because he knew I was one. That was appreciated.Would you introduce him to your friends? Who says “No” to that?Describe him in three words.Genuine, chatty and kind.What do you think he made of you?Nice enough to give me a cactus.Did you go on somewhere?No.And… did you kiss?No.If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?We could both have been a bit weirder. I felt like I was trying to make myself seem more normal.Marks out of 10?A solid 7 – he was really nice, just not my type.Would you meet again?Given we’re at the same swimming club, I have no doubt I’ll bump into him at the lido at some point.What were you hoping for?A good craic.First impressions?Charming, with a remarkable drive.What did you talk about?School shenanigans, the NHS and her grouting skills.Any awkward moments?None springs to mind, which probably means they were all committed by me.Good table manners?Impeccable.Best thing about Libby?She’s admirably worldly.Would you introduce her to your friends? I can think of a few she’d get on famously with.Describe her in three words.Stylish, composed, confident.What do you think she made of you?I refrained from the dad jokes, so, whatever she says, it could have been worse.Did you go on somewhere?After seven paired wines, I think we’d had our fill.And… did you kiss?My grandmother will be reading this.If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?I wouldn’t have given her the cactus.Marks out of 10?7.Would you meet again?I’m sure we will at the lido.• Libby and Ed ate at Texture, London W1 Fancy a blind date?
