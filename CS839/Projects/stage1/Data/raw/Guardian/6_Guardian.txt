I am still only 27 and feel ready to meet a new partner, but I don’t know how to tell our two small children, let alone raise the subject with any woman I might be interested in

About 18 months ago, and after four years of happy marriage, my wife suddenly died. I am still only 27 and believe I am ready to start dating again. But I have no idea what to do with things still connected to my wife. Would it be disrespectful to stop wearing my wedding ring? Is it normal to keep the photos of us on display around the house? We have two children and I will never let them forget her, but how do I tell them that I am dating someone new? I haven’t got round to mentioning my situation to any women I may like to go out with in the future.
