So that’s us done for another day. Join us again tomorrow! Updated
at 10.13am EST


9.31am EST
09:31

Sweden look absolutely shocked! Chin up lads, desolation will soon take over. 

9.30am EST
09:30

Well who expected that? 

9.30am EST
09:30

It was as far as I can see, easily. But the decision is referred ... did the Swedish goalie have the puck under control?Updated
at 9.38am EST


9.29am EST
09:29

And Germany have poked one home from close range! Their players are all over the ice, but was the puck over the line?Updated
at 9.39am EST


9.28am EST
09:28

Our ten minutes of overtime are away. 

9.23am EST
09:23

Germany-Sweden has finished 3-3, and we’ll now have a period of overtime. 

9.22am EST
09:22

Finland have binned their keeper as they search for an equaliser, but they can’t find one! 

9.20am EST
09:20

Just 59 seconds to go in the Canada-Finland match. Canada are nearly there. 

9.17am EST
09:17

All Sweden now – they’ve just over five minutes to find a winner. 

9.11am EST
09:11

And Fransson has equalised for Sweden with a drive from range! What a match this is! 8.20 to go!Updated
at 9.27am EST


9.08am EST
09:08

7.40 to go on the other rink, where Canada lead Finland 1-0. 

9.08am EST
09:08

I should note that a Germany win would represent a huge upset; they’re the rank outsiders of the countries left, while SWeden are second-favourites after OAR. 

9.07am EST
09:07

Or not! A booming slap-shot from Hersley and with 10.25 left we have ourselves a ball game! 

9.04am EST
09:04

Or not! Germany now lead 3-1! Dominic Kahun scores, and surely that’s enough to see them into the semis?

9.01am EST
09:01

Canada are seeing this out without undue alarm. But Sweden have pulled one back against Germany, so that is now getting fraught. 

8.52am EST
08:52

So all we’ve got left today is hockey, and in our remaining men’s quarters, Germany still lead Sweden 2-0. Canada v Finland, meanwhile, is 0-0 ... no it isn’t! A face-off falls kindly for Maxim Noreau, and he absolutely punishes home an opener! 19.05 of the final period to go! 

8.47am EST
08:47

Buckwitz is crying and shouting, while Jamanka looks absolutely stunned. No one expected them to win, probably not even them, but here we are! 

8.46am EST
08:46

But she puts it in, and finishes -0.07! Meyers Taylor applauds, and has another silver for her draw. Humphries of Canada takes bronze. Updated
at 9.41am EST


8.45am EST
08:45

Jamanka is +0.08! She needs to get on with this! 

8.43am EST
08:43

50.73, Meyers Taylor’s third fastest time of the competition. She’s got silver, but what will Mairama Jamanka of Germany do now? 

8.43am EST
08:43

She’s 0.41 inside Humphries, but the silver was always happening; she’s going for gold, as Rick Witter once said. 

8.42am EST
08:42

Off goes Meyers Taylor of USA! She’s won everything but this, can she do enough for gold?

8.41am EST
08:41

Humphries of Canada, one of the greats of the sport, hurtles down in 50.77 and guarantees herself a bronze medal. 

8.40am EST
08:40

Anyway, for more on Mica McNeill, check out Don McRae’s interview...

8.39am EST
08:39

Greubel Poser doesn’t quite nail it, clattering the side wall at the start, and it looks like she’ll have to content herself with fourth. 

8.38am EST
08:38

Schneider of Germany lays down the first sub-51s run; will it be enough to sneak a medal? Probably not, and Jamie Greubel Poser of USA is now in position...

8.35am EST
08:35

Rissling of Canada has a fine run, and with it goes McNeill’s last chance of improving her position. But the top five will now contest the medals...

8.33am EST
08:33

In the ice hockey, Canada-Finland is still 0-0 and Sweden-Germany is still 0-2. Both are playing the second period. 

8.32am EST
08:32

De Bruin of Canada’s run is scrappy, but she hangs on to stay seventh. McNeill, who’ll be happy with eighth, will wonder about that third run and what might otherwise have been. 

8.31am EST
08:31

Well in Mica McNeill! Only in the Games thanks to crowd funding, she has secured eighth place - at least. She finished 0.23s inside Hafner, and at just 24 has lots of room and time for improvement before Beijing in four years. Updated
at 8.39am EST


8.29am EST
08:29

McNeill hits an edge, but is 0.15 inside the time of Switzerland’s Hafner, and this is a really good run! 

8.28am EST
08:28

At the sliding centre, GB’s Mica McNeill is ready to go, and should be able to consolidate eighth - at least. 

8.27am EST
08:27

But quickly back to the speedskating for this. 

8.26am EST
08:26

Right, let’s get on with the women’s bob. Nine competitors left in that, and the battles are for bronze, then silver and gold. 

8.25am EST
08:25

That really was a phenomenal performance from Norway, upsetting Netherlands, Sven Kramer and all, then the hosts. In fairness, it’s about time they dominated this event as well. 

8.24am EST
08:24

Korea have to make do with second. Updated
at 9.06am EST


8.23am EST
08:23

Korea made up this kind of deficit against New Zealand but Norway are kicking it! At the bell they lead by 1.02s, and this is O-V-E-R!

8.22am EST
08:22

Norway lead by 0.10s with three laps remaining, and extend to 0.42s! 

8.21am EST
08:21

But Korea reel them in, and over the course of 400m, take the lead! Norway respond, and now lead by 0.19! 

8.21am EST
08:21

Wow, Norway are going away! 

8.20am EST
08:20

Korea took the Olympic record in the semis, and are strong favourites for this race. But Norway started brilliantly and are 0.47s ahead at the first check. 

8.19am EST
08:19



8.19am EST
08:19

So here it comes: Norway v Korea for the gold!

8.17am EST
08:17

And they do – by 5.14s, noch. 

8.16am EST
08:16

New Zealand must’ve spent themselves in the semis because they’re nearly four seconds down. Netherlands are going to take the bronze. 

8.13am EST
08:13

Netherlands and New Zealand are on the ice, both of whom fancied themselves finalists. 

8.08am EST
08:08

In the meantime, we’ll enjoy the medal races in the men’s team pursuit. 

8.08am EST
08:08

The final run of the women’s bob is underway, but this time they go in reverse order so it won’t get exciting for a bit. 

8.03am EST
08:03

What a win that is! They came from behind to win by over a second, and Netherlands must be make do with bronze. Updated
at 8.09am EST
